Stock Market Rally: What To Do Next  An uptrend under pressure means investors need to be much more cautious, but not go entirely to cash. Watch sell signals closely. Be sure to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price, and maybe even 3% or 4% if you want to raise cash.  Avoid buying stocks for now, unless the breakout is exceptionally good. The best candidates are those that proved most resilient during the recent stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with strong relative strength lines. These ideas could become stock market leaders.  Use MarketSmith features like the RS Line Blue Dot to easily spot such stock candidates. The RS Line Blue Dot is assigned to stocks whose RS lines are making new highs while the stock is basing or breaking out.

* INSG nickel market balances: https://tmsnrt.rs/3jw7CXW
By Andy Home
LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) nickel price last week touched a year-to-date high of $16,135 per tonne.
Nickel bulls would love to believe this is all about rising usage in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The EV story has generated a tangible buzz in the nickel market over the last two years with Tesla s Elon Musk recently fanning the flames with his call for more mines to meet demand for electrification.
However, the reality is that the recent rally is much more about that most traditional of price drivers, namely the supply of nickel ore to China s giant stainless steel sector.
Such old-school dynamics are going to push the global market into a period of over-supply this year and next, according to the latest forecasts from the International Nickel Study Group (INSG).
The EV narrative, for now at least, is stuck in the slow lane.
ALL ABOUT ORE
The key metric to understanding the recent nickel price rally is the cost of nickel ore, according to analysts at Citi.
The Philippines has emerged as the main supplier of raw material to China s nickel pig iron (NPI) producers since Indonesia banned exports at the start of this year.
The price of medium-grade Philippine ore has doubled over the course of this year to a current $74 per tonne, according to Chinese research house Custeel.
That in turn feeds directly into higher costs for the NPI producers that supply China s stainless steel mills.
The Indonesian ore ban is reaching ""its climax"" with Chinese stocks falling to ""critical levels"" and the Philippines heading into the monsoon season, which limits mining activity, Citi said.
The bank has a ""bull-case"" price target of $17,000 per tonne in the fourth quarter of this year but ""from these highs we would be ready to flip cautious-bearish.""
That s because China s NPI production is declining as the supply chain migrates to Indonesia, which implemented its ore ban to force miners to upgrade to value-added products such as NPI.
This year ""likely marks the last year when China will produce more NPI than Indonesia,"" agrees JPMorgan.
The transition will see flows of Indonesian NPI become the dominant trade for Chinese stainless production.
Philippine ore prices will likely revert back to historical norms of around $35 per tonne which ""will depress costs of marginal Chinese NPI smelters to around $13,000/t, thus removing the cost support for spot nickel prices,"" JPMorgan said. (""Metals Weekly"", Oct. 26 2020)
SURPLUS AHEAD
Such traditional nickel price drivers, particularly the strength of global stainless steel output, will dominate the market for a while yet.
Global output of stainless steel fell by 9.4% in the first half of this year and will fall over the year as a whole despite a rebound in China, the INSG said.
Next year should be a year of recovery but by how much is very uncertain outside of China, where the consensus is for this year s V-shaped recovery to level out.
Global nickel production, by contrast, has been relatively unscathed by the lockdowns that have hit other industrial metals and will grow strongly next year as Indonesia s reconfigured nickel production sector ramps up.
The INSG now sees world output of primary metal at 2.436 million tonnes this year, a marginal 40,000-tonne reduction from the Group s last forecast in October 2019. Production growth will accelerate from 2.3% this year to 6.2% next year.
The Group therefore expects the refined nickel market to register supply surpluses of 117,000 tonnes this year and another 68,000 tonnes in 2021.
These will be the first years of excess supply since 2015.
EV SLOW LANE
What then of nickel s EV story?
It seems to be losing some of its traction, according to LME broker Marex Spectron.
Interest in nickel and electric vehicles peaked early in October and ""has reversed noticeably since then"", according to what the company calls its ""Nowcast"", a series of algorithms that trawl the web to monitor around a billion text documents per year for references between specific commodities and market themes.
""This begs the question of whether the recent reversal in EV Market Focus portends a declining interest in the key demand story for the metal,"" Marex said. (""Quantamental Update - Has the focus on EV as a key nickel demand driver peaked?"", Oct. 26, 2020).
This might seem counter-intuitive given all the headlines generated by Musk s call for more nickel mines.
But COVID-19 has laid low the entire automotive sector, even if EV production is bouncing back more strongly than conventional vehicles as governments prioritise ""green"" investment in their recovery plans.
Electric vehicles currently account for less than 5% of total nickel usage and the fear, to quote Macquarie Bank analysts, is the coronavirus will translate into ""two lost years for the electric vehicle market, pushing back the requirements for new nickel supply (...) all the way out to 2025.""
This theme of deferred expectations has been playing out across the battery metals space, witness this week s news that Australian hard-rock lithium miner Altura Mining has entered receivership due to low prices for its spodumene product.
Nickel s role in the EV revolution has also taken something of a dent from Tesla itself, which is using non-nickel batteries in its Model 3 cars in China. The switch to lithium-iron-phosphate batteries reduces costs but also reflects technical enhancements to a product that was regarded as legacy technology just a year ago.
It is becoming clear that battery design is not going to be a binary competition such as the much-cited 1980s battle between Betamax and VHS in video-taping. Rather, multiple technologies will co-exist to feed a differentiated global market for vehicle functionality.
This is not to say that EVs won t be a critical component of the nickel market going forwards, just that the relationship between sales growth and nickel usage may not be as linear as previously thought.
Nickel bulls may have to defer their great EV expectations for a while yet and focus on what is happening in the currently far more significant stainless steel sector. If the INSG is right, it could be a bumpy ride."

But as traders get more experienced, they may look for early entries to start or add to positions. A classic ""early entry"" is a downward-sloping trend line in handles.

Tesla stock, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), JD.com and Inphi have all come up to these trend lines and quickly pulled back.

4,2020-10-27,20:01:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-bezos-musk-charging-ahead-000100424.html,"Blackrock, Bezos And Musk Charging Ahead in this $30 Trillion Mega-Trend","A massive $250 billion has poured into ESG index funds since August, making ESG an investing megatrend that’s soared over 733% in just two years and has had over $30 trillion invested globally.This is Big Capital’s new safe haven and some of the largest names in finance and tech from Goldman Sachs, to Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are investing heavily.ESG is considered a less risky and increasingly lucrative corner of Wall Street. The multi-trillion-dollar reality is that tech and ESG are now inextricably linked.And they are massively outperforming the market.The holy grail of this new trend, therefore, should be a solid ESG platform combined with an impressive tech ecosystem.And now, there’s a company that’s managed to do just that. Facedrive (TSXV:FD; OTC:FDVRF)—the Canadian tech darling that’s been stealing headlines across multiple sectors. It’s a company that’s grasped the enormity of this megatrend.It knows what Big Capital—like the $7 trillion finance giant BlackRock —wants. It understands that big money is looking for more places to park on the in-demand ESG playing field. And it doesn’t want a limited, one-off opportunity.It wants an entire ecosystem of ESG tech offerings with limitless verticals. That’s why Facedrive, one of the most impressively ambitious innovators to have come out of Canada’s Waterloo ‘Technology Triangle’ (aka the new ‘Silicon Valley’) - has created, launched, and exceptionally branded 6 entire ESG divisions in just one year. It’s been hot on the acquisition trail for months, and its latest grab was a game-changer:Two Huge Disruptors in Two MonthsIn September, Facedrive scooped up Chicago-based Steer, an EV subscription service that aims to upend the $5 trillion global transportation industry, in a deal that includes a $2-million strategic investment by energy giant Exelon’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Exelorate Enterprises, LLC. 
The pioneer of carbon-offset ride-sharing in Canada, Facedrive—behind the wheel of Steer—plans to completely change the way people view car ownership. 
Anyone who wanted but couldn’t afford an EV before, can now afford an EV ride, with Steer. That means Steer and its heavy-weight owners and backers will be disrupting industry segments on multiple levels. 
Exelon’s  market cap is ~$41 billion ... and it’s not the only huge market-cap company whose radar Facedrive is pinging: There’s also a tie-in to ecommerce king Amazon  ....
Steer is at the crossroads where $25 trillion meets: 
The $5 trillion IT industry
The $12 trillion digital economy
The $8 trillion auto industry
And it’s all boosted by the fastest-growing megatrend of the year—ESG investing. But Steer is just the most recent move by Facedrive, the tech giant’s previous deal was arguably even bigger.In August, Facedrive acquired Tally Technologies, the high-tech major league sports predicting startup founded by NFL superstar Russel Wilson. Tally came out of TraceMe, a celebrity content app founded by Wilson with early-in investors from the biggest tech companies in the world and acquired by Nike last year. And that acquisition turned some of the biggest names in the tech industry into Facedrive shareholders ... because the transaction was a share exchange that saw Facedrive inject $1M in cash in Tally and $2M in Facedrive shares. 
Now, Tally plans to revolutionize major league sports with “gamification” and online fan engagement. 
Gamified for ultimate fan engagement, this major league sports platform will now be free-to-play and predictive. 
That means new revenue potential for major leagues sports, which is exactly why Tally has already been chosen by the NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB as the premier tech solution. 
All-Inclusive Tech on the Front Lines of COVID-19
There’s hardly a better “impact” investing element to add to your ESG portfolio than a contact tracing app designed to counter the COVID-19 pandemic with its very own line of wearables ... 
The company’s TraceSCAN contact-tracing technology is positioned to help save the tourism industry, which is facing $1 trillion in losses due to the pandemic and is expected to shed 100 million jobs before the year is out worldwide. 
Aviation giant Air Canada is already on board. 
On October 7th, Air Canada signed a deal with Facedrive Inc. (TSXV:FD,OTC:FDVRF) to launch a pilot project for its employees using proprietary TraceSCAN technology. 
TraceSCAN Wearables could help the tourism industry deal with COVID. Facedrive combines complex algorithms in an AI-enabled mobile application with wearable devices built on the industry standard nRF52 Bluetooth chipset.  
That means it can reach those millions of workers around the world, from construction and medical to education and security, who can’t operate with a phone in hand 24/7, as well as the at-risk elderly.  
It’s fully mobile COVID-19 detection on a wristband, in a tag worn around the neck or in a pocket pod. And it intends to get us back to work, and back to fun--safely.  
Air Canada isn’t the only major airline taking the TraceSCAN plunge... The Government of Ontario lent its support to TraceSCAN back in July because it’s the only feasible technology that will help get masses of government employees back to work without spreading COVID-19.And now, talks with other airlines are in motion because the industry is facing more than $84 billion in losses ... so, the news flow is expected to be fast and momentous. 
The Tech Company That Has It AllEven before it acquired Steer with the aim to change the way we view car ownership ...And before it jumped into Tally, the innovative tech that creates major sports revenue verticals for our interactive, engaged future ...Facedrive already had 5 ESG divisions, making it a one-stop-shop for multi-industry tech-driven ESG. From its pioneering carbon-neutral ride-sharing and long-distance carpooling platform, food and pharmacy deliveries and COVID contact-trading to its own celebrity-branded merch marketplace (think: Will Smith’s Bel Air Athletics) and a blockbuster social distancing trivia and social engagement app, Facedrive has the kind of verticals the new big money is looking for. Until now, Facedrive’s ESG platform has been stealing headlines across industries in Canada...But the Steer deal plants it firmly in the United States, where the next big push is about to take place. Big names have already tied into this wide-ranging tech play ... from  energy giant Exelon to Air Canada ...There’s been no faster news flow coming out of the Toronto Stock Exchange than this ...And the next big name to sign on to any one of these tech deals is likely to have serious impact. Some other companies looking to capitalize on the sustainability push:
Facebook (FB) has truly taken the ESG trend to heart. It has dedicated a lot of resources on constructing more sustainable work environments. It s building designs integrate a variety of renewable energy sources and water recycling methods, in addition to promoting the recycling and sustainability of all items taken in on-site. Not only that, it also focuses on its workforce, with equal opportunity hiring policies, ample time off, and much more. Facebook is also taking an ingenious approach in its goal to cut back its carbon footprint. Its massive data centers are some of the most efficient on the planet. And it s only beginning. By the end of this year, Facebook intends to have all of its data centers running on 100% green energy. Microsoft (MSFT) is another key tech giant integrating sustainability into its business model. Microsoft is going above and beyond in its carbon emissions promise. It is aiming to be carbon neutral in the next ten years. Not just is the tech giant taking a major role in minimizing its carbon emissions, but it is also at the forefront of a technological wave that is actively helping other companies control their emissions.Microsoft has built many new technologies to assist and assess the impact of different companies on the environment, helping collect data to better comprehend where and how the world can become greener. In addition, Microsoft is creating tools to better control water use and curb the world s growing waste issues.Not to be outdone, Google (GOOGL) is fixated on raising the bar for the smart use of the world s dwindling resources. Like Facebook, Google is developing sustainable, energy-efficient data centers and office environments. It is likewise leveraging artificial intelligence to create a system that will help the world use energy in a more efficient manner. Google is also concentrated on building a sustainable supply chain. It is dedicated to enhancing the lives of everyone linked to its products, from its data centers to truck drivers and beyond. Additionally, it is actively decreasing its ecological impact by working with suppliers to offer them the tools and tech they need to become more energy efficient.NextEra Energy (NEE), the world leader in solar and wind producer, is playing a crucial role in the course towards sustainability. In fact, in 2018, the business was the top capital investor in green energy facilities and the 5th biggest investor across all sectors.In addition to its huge influence on global climate change, it has a plan to invest another $55 billion in American energy facilities in the next 2 years. All while keeping a firm dedication to minimize its reliance on foreign oil. Since 2001, it has detached itself from foreign oil almost entirely, announcing a 98% decline over the past twenty years. Much more enticing, however, is its dedication to developing investor value. Over the past 15 years, investors have seen 945% returns.We can’t talk about ESG without mentioning Tesla .There’s a reason Tesla has performed so well this year. Investors love Elon Musk’s vision. As one of the world’s most innovative car manufacturers, it has single-handedly made electric vehicles cool. Its slick design is beloved across the world. In fact, it’s almost impossible to NOT see a Tesla in cities like Hong Kong or San Francisco.  Though Tesla has received some poor marks for its workplace health and safety due to a few incidents of employees feeling overworked and under-appreciated compared to its peers, Tesla scores very high on pollution prevention and corporate governance.Canadian business are doing their part:
Stars Group Inc  is a world leader in the online and mobile gaming industry. With a focus on maintaining high regulatory standards while simultaneously offering a wide range of products across multiple platforms, Stars has solidified its place among the gaming hierarchy.
In December, Stars Group secured a major partnership with the National Basketball Association in order to use data and league marks across their digital sports betting offerings.Scott Kaufman-Ross, Head of Fantasy & Gaming, NBA explained, ""This dynamic partnership will be another way to create authentic fan engagement with league logos and official NBA betting data, while leveraging Stars  global expertise to further optimize the fan experience.ePlay Digital Inc.  creates technology that helps TV networks, esports teams and leagues and even venues cut through the noise to reach their target audience. The company brings together multiple platforms to create engagement across social media, traditional media, streaming, and more. With a team built from sports, esports, and gaming experts, ePlay knows the video game industry inside and out. That’s why they’ve secured partnerships with companies including Time Warner Cable, ESPN, Sony Pictures, AXS TV, Intel, AXN, Fiat, CBS, Cineplex, and others.Shaw Communications Inc.  is major player in the Canadian telecoms sector. It owns a ton of infrastructure throughout Canada and its cloud services and open-source projects look to address some of the biggest issues that its customers might face before the customers even face them. As online gaming depends on solid internet connections, Shaw will likely become a backdoor benefactor in increased online activity. Telus Corporation  is Canada’s second largest internet provider, serving over 8 million Canadians from coast to coast. Though it’s not producing its own content, it is carving out its own path in the industry thanks to its innovative approach to technology and investments across multiple sectors.Like Shaw, Telus will be another company to watch as gamers, and the general population, turn to their phones and computers for entertainment.

A full transcript follows the video.  This video was recorded on October 22, 2020.  Chris Hill: It s Thursday, October 22nd. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I m Chris Hill, with me today, Mr. Jason Moser. Good to see you my friend.  Jason Moser: Good to see you.  Hill: We ve got -- I said it before, it s my favorite time of year, and it comes four times a year, we got earnings season heating up. We got Chipotle , we got Tesla , we re going to perform an autopsy on Quibi.  Let s start with Tesla, though. Tesla reported a profit in the third quarter that was higher than Wall Street was expecting, and this is the fifth quarter in a row that Tesla has delivered a profit. Stock up about 5% this morning. It was one of those things where the lightbulb went off above my head this morning, Jason. It was like the fifth quarter in a row, profits, earnings... oh, wait! they have a P/E ratio now, I wonder what it is, and it s just shy of 1,100.  Moser: Oh, I mean, I guess the market is just pulling forward some very robust expectations, let s just maybe leave it at that. You know, I don t have a dog in this hunt, so to speak, I don t own Tesla shares, I ve not recommended it, I ve not short it, I enjoy following this business, learning from it and there s some entertainment value there for sure. The core business here is just really so simple, right? I mean, they make cars and they sell them to people. And yet it s such a sideshow to the distractions and the drama with analysts, they re so dead-set on one position or the other. I mean, you go on Twitter, and it s just this back-and-forth that never ends. And honestly, it s like DC, I mean, nobody is going to budge, right?  But to your point, fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. Yeah, we could sit there and argue about how they got to profitability, and I ll note that regulatory credits, I think, are probably a big question that a lot of folks will continue to harp on, how important are they. I think in regard to Tesla s business, regulatory credits are very important, but that shouldn t be a surprise. That s how you incentivize moving an entire society over to a new technology like this that we re so reliant on in transportation.  And so, this year so far, they ve taken advantage of about $1.2 billion in those credits, and that clearly affects profitability, that s good for them. But I don t hold that against them, because they re just playing the hand that they were dealt, they are playing with the rules of the game more or less. If you compare that to last year at this time, they claimed about $460 million in credit. So, clearly a considerable amount more in credits this year than last, and I m sure that s something that we ll continue to see them take advantage of to the extent they can. But I mean, they produced just over 145,000 vehicles, they delivered almost 140,000.  And I think, while Musk certainly loves to aim high, and I think he should, their 500,000 deliveries for the year remains a target. Now, that is a high goal. That s a lofty goal. They need about 180,000 to go. They need about 180,000 this final quarter. Maybe they get there, maybe they don t, but I think the more time goes on, the more we re seeing the market is willing to give this business time to do its thing. And not every business out there can claim that luxury, but you see companies like Amazon, for the longest time, the market really gave Bezos the leash to run with that business and build it. You see the same thing happening here.  So, I m for the business, I love what he s trying to do, I think it s funny to listen to just people go back-and-forth on the valuation and whatnot, but here we are and this is clearly a business that s making a big impact in the world.  Hill: Yeah, there are definitely a couple of analysts, I was watching on CNBC this morning, who are bearish on Tesla. And they re getting kind of worked up. [laughs] It was just one of those things where I felt a little bad for them, I don t know, I mean ...  Moser: And like I said, I don t dive into that discussion because it s just so unproductive. So, I d say the one thing, like, if you look at where they are today in regard to the balance sheet. I mean, they re quarter in, they re cash equivalents jumped from $6 billion to $14.5 billion. Now, remember they had a capital raise here recently; I think they raised around $5 billion. If I had one piece of advice for Elon Musk -- and listen, Chris, I m a dummy, OK, I know that. I mean, he s not asking me for advice, but if I were to give him one piece of advice. You know, like we ve talked before about Tom Gardner s philosophy on your holding period, right? However long you plan to hold a stock, just, boom! Automatically double that, right, double that holding period and you ll benefit from it. I feel like any time he wants to raise money, double it, because it s just clear as day that any lever he wants to pull, he s going to be able to raise that money without too much trouble. And particularly where the stock is today, I mean, if he gets to a point where he needs to raise more capital, and he probably will, I mean, he sees the energy business ultimately being as large as the vehicle business one day, and that s going to require a lot of investment too. Yeah, anytime you re ready to raise some money, just go ahead and double it. I think that would be a nice rule of thumb.  Hill: Third quarter profits and revenue for Chipotle came in higher than expected. Same-store sales were north of 8%, and Chipotle s digital sales tripled year-over-year. And despite all that, shares down more than 5%. What is going on here, did Brian Niccol say something on the call?  Moser: [laughs] No, no, no, no. I think there are a couple of things that are probably coming into play here. No. 1, I think it s probably selling a little bit on valuation, in that, the stock is trading for over 120X full-year earnings estimates. I mean, this is still a burrito company basically at the end of the day. So, you know, +120X, that s a pretty expensive burrito, so to speak. So, I think there s probably a little bit of selling on the valuation side of it, but there s also some concern there. And fair concern, I think, in the delivery, and we ll talk about that in a minute. But I do think it s just amazing.  I was thinking about this yesterday, the Chipotle story, it s amazing to watch here over the last several years, because they went from a restaurant that really couldn t stop from getting people sick to now being, like, one of the best operators in the entire space during a pandemic where a lot of people are getting sick. So, just hats off to Brian Niccol, the CEO. I think he s just done such a good job with this business since he took over, and it goes to show you the value in hiring folks with a lot of industry expertise like he has coming over from Taco Bell. So, for what it s worth, I think they made a great call on the CEO side.  But when you start looking at the numbers, I mean, it really does feel like Chipotle is turning into Domino s, it s really interesting to see. They have over 17 million loyalty program members now versus just 7 million a year ago. And that s all thanks, really, to a very strong app. And if you looked [laughs] on the call, as I did, the word ""delivery"" was mentioned 45 times on yesterday s earnings call. A year ago, it was mentioned six times. And I think that is potentially a source of some market concern as well, because when you look at delivery, the digital sales numbers were really impressive, they grew over 200%. They represented close to 50% of sales. About half of digital was delivery, and the concern there, and they note this. And so, I want to read this exactly as they noted.  But here s the crux of it, they say the amount that we remit to our delivery partner for sale through our app and website is higher than what we collect from customers and is included in other operating costs. So, delivery is something that is, yeah, it s driving the topline maybe a little bit, but it s also something tampering profitability. And they re going to have to figure out a way to square that at some point, but for now, they re doing a really good job in the face of what is a very difficult restaurant space, utilizing that delivery lever, really growing that part of the business. I don t hold that against them, I understand maybe a little bit of the concern in the near-term, but I think that when you look at all of these numbers put together, you still have to be very bullish on this company s future.  Hill: We ve talked before about the opportunity they have in terms of expansion, to grow their footprint. Gary Kelly, the CEO of Southwest Airlines, was talking this morning about corporate travel and how he thinks that s going to take 10 years for corporate travel to fully recover for the airline industry. David Chang, the restaurateur and chef was tweeting this morning about how the restaurant industry is tied to corporate business. And you know, putting those two together and, in particular, David Chang s comments, it really does seem like a longer opportunity for that type of investment for Chipotle to grow its footprint.  Moser: Yeah. I absolutely agree. I mean, I think they ve done a very good job of not trying to expand too quickly, that can be one of the dangers of franchising is that it gives you the opportunity to grow really quickly, but sometimes that can be a little bit of an anchor on you if times are a little tougher. And so, they opened 44 new restaurants during the quarter, and closed only three. They have just over 2,700 stores today, and most of them are all open.  Since sales really hit their low in March, they ve been able to retain, they said, 80% to 85% of the digital sales gains, while recovering about 50% to 55% of their in-store sales. So, again, I think that when you see how they re slowly and methodically growing that footprint and then they re also making sure that they utilize that physical store footprint for more than just the in-store dining experience or even picking up for that matter, again, I go back to Domino s, and really one of the things that Domino s really done so well through the years is utilizing that physical footprint to essentially offer two different businesses, right, it s a pickup and it s a delivery. And I think that Chipotle is really starting to exploit that as well.  And if you do it right, if you do it well, it can be really, really valuable over many years. And Domino s investors, you know what I m talking about. If you held on that [laughs] stock for the last +10 years, you are just loving life. Now, I m not saying Chipotle will be Domino s, it s pizza versus burritos, and probably a little bit of a different market opportunity there, but I think that Chipotle is going to continue to be able to focus on the core Mexican food business for some time to come. And at 2,700 stores today, you know, they re going to keep on opening up 100 new stores a year here-and-there for the foreseeable future. And so, for investors, you have to love that, because now we re going to see two different drivers of sales from not only the store itself, but also the delivery model that they ll perfect that, they ll get it down, and it ll become something that s a bit more profitable and meaningful to the bottom-line, it s just going to take a little time.  Hill: Six months after its launch in April, Quibi, the short-video streaming service, is being shut down due to a complete lack of interest. The company was started all the way back in August of 2018 by Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman. They raised $1.75 billion and then proceeded to light that money on fire. Where do you want to begin with this guy, because one thought I had, and we were chatting a little bit about this yesterday, is that capitalism works. Like, among other things, this is an example of capitalism working. They built this thing, they spent a lot of money to do it, they put it out there, and everyone collected and said ""no.""  Moser: Yeah, I mean, you re absolutely right. This is a great example of capitalism working. And there are a lot of different ways to go with this. And I don t want to make light of the fact that people are losing their jobs from this, though, I will say that even for the most glass half full person, jumping on board with this entity, you had to probably feel like the chances of success were going to be lower than 50%, I would have assumed, but it seemed like it was a little bit obvious all of us in the analyst community. But it was amazing to me, I read in one of the articles that during a video call with employees, Katzenberg actually suggested that staffers listen to the song Get Back Up Again from the Trolls film to buoy their spirits. I mean, it s like he s still talking to his own booking, [laughs] he s getting ready to lay a bunch of people off is what it sounded like. But it was very odd, like, I don t know, I feel like, it just didn t seem to me to be as sympathetic as probably it could have been.  But we talked about this a few shows ago, right, a few weeks back, where I don t think anyone, including Jeffrey Katzenberg, really knew what Quibi was supposed to be. I mean, is it social, is it streaming, is it social streaming? I mean, there were already all sorts of competitors out there in that space to some extent. And so, sometimes, in investing, like we say, sometimes investing, you just have to be able to call the mistake, admit it, move on, as opposed to just keeping on burning money. And it sounds like in this case, I mean, they burned through their capital, and that was basically that. And I think the writing is on the wall. It sounded like a lot of Hollywood was doubtful to begin with, interestingly enough, they didn t have a problem selling [laughs] content, they re like, hey, sure, we ll sell it to you, but we don t think you re going to succeed.  So, listen, when you jump into a crowded space like this, and video streaming is a crowded space, obviously, you need to differentiate yourself, you need to innovate, do something different, and it just didn t seem like they did that, like, at all. And you know, speaking of Seinfeld, it reminded me of that reservation s episode of Seinfeld, it all comes back to Seinfeld, Chris. But it s like, you say you know how to get in there, differentiate or innovate, but you don t actually know how to do it. Saying it doesn t mean that you re doing it. And it didn t feel like they really had come to that realization until it was just way too late.  Hill: So, one of the thoughts I ve had about all this is, I feel like we need to come up with a new word to replace the word ""unicorn"" as it is used in the world of investing. And for those unfamiliar, a unicorn is a private company that reaches a private market valuation of $1 billion. And I was thinking about something Emily Flippen said on the show a few weeks back where she made the comment like, the world is only getting bigger, we re only going to have more companies with $1 trillion market caps in the future, not fewer. And so, as things continue, I think we need to come up with a different -- because, you know, that was part of it, that s like, oh! look at this company, they ve raised nearly $2 billion, you know? What would this be worth in the open market? That s like, well, it turns out zero. So, yeah ...  Moser: Yeah, I look at some of these capital raises with some of these businesses, and it s astounding the money that some of these businesses raise. And it s just astounding, I mean, it s breathtaking, [laughs] like you said. Look at Robinhood, for example. With all of the trouble and issues that they continue to have, I don t know why anybody who s getting started investing today, why would you use Robinhood, because every other platform could basically match what they re doing for the most part and it s going to be a more robust and, frankly, trustworthy platform. And yet, this business continues to raise billions and billions of dollars, and it s garnered something like +$10 billion market valuation. Now, that to me seems really absurd, but it just goes to show, man, there are some very deep pockets when it comes to these VC interests and investors who aren t necessarily participating in the public markets. And I think the thing is, in most cases it s really all about hitting a couple of homeruns as opposed to trying to get, like, 60% of your picks right. I think most people know that they re not going to be getting 60% of those picks right, it s really just about finding a couple of grand slams that can make a big impact.  Hill: Yeah. I mean, the unicorn is an incredibly rare creature, and private market valuations of $1 billion are becoming increasingly less rare. I ll tell you what is really a unicorn, it s something like Quibi, something that from day one, we all sort of looked at and we re like, I don t think that s going to work, and then every step along the way, like, yeah, no, it s still not working. The launch isn t going well, they re burning cash, like, oh, my God! They re exploring strategic alternatives. Oh, they re dead.  Like, I can t think of another time when, you know, there was a business -- you know, maybe Pets.com back in the day, but ...  Moser: [laughs] It feels like there are always going to be those examples. That s why this job is so fun, because we get to see this stuff every day. I mean, the market, at the end of the day, we said it, it s just like a really big disagreement. And both parties think they re right for whatever reasons, and you have to figure out a way to reconcile that and choose a side. I think we chose ours on this one very early on.  Hill: Yeah, if only we had a chance to short it. All right. We ll wrap up there. Jason, always great talking to you. Thanks for being here.  Moser: Yep, thank you.  Hill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.  That s going to do it for this edition of MarketFoolery. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd, I m Chris Hill, thanks for listening, we ll see you on Monday."
6,2020-10-27,19:02:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mercedes-bets-evolution-tesla-touts-230258319.html,Mercedes bets on evolution as Tesla touts revolution in automated driving,"By Edward Taylor
IMMENDINGEN, Germany (Reuters) - As Tesla touts the cutting-edge nature of its new Full Self Driving software, rival Mercedes-Benz says it has developed a similar system but stops short of allowing members of the public to take it on urban roads.
The Germans, pioneers in developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), are taking a step-by-step approach to releasing new technology, waiting for their own engineers, rather than the general public, to validate their system.
Both approaches - one conservative and one radical in nature - are designed to push highly automated driving on to public roads, a step that could massively reduce accidents, since computers have faster accident-avoidance reflexes than humans.
Advanced driver assistance systems can provide steering, braking and acceleration support under limited circumstances, generally on highways. Carmakers have refrained from relying on their technology to let cars navigate urban inner-city traffic.
Tesla broke this tradition last week when it released its FSD software which allows its computer-powered cars to practise their reflexes in inner-city traffic situations, with a warning that its cars ""May Do the Wrong Thing at the Worst Time.""
Mercedes does not allow members of the public to test still-experimental systems. Its engineers need to pass an eligibility exam to become test drivers, and another one for testing automated driving systems, the carmaker said.
Rather than force their customers to put their trust in processors, software and the ability of machines to learn over time, the Germans want their cars to be validated by engineers so that they remain predictable for owners.
""We do not want blind trust. We want informed trust in the car. The customer needs to know exactly what the car can and cannot do,"" a Mercedes spokesman told Reuters on the sidelines of the carmaker s test track in Immendingen, Germany.
""The worst thing would be if the car gets into a complex situation and there was ambiguity over whether the car is in control or not,"" he said.
This is why the Stuttgart-based carmaker, owned by Daimler AG, is emphasising its decades-old experience of automated driver assistance systems as it seeks to gain global regulatory approval for its own Drive Pilot system which boasts level 3 automation.
Level 3 means the driver can legally take their eyes off the wheel and the company, Daimler in this case, would have to assume insurance liability, depending on the jurisdiction.
The new Tesla system forces customers to take responsibility for any crash.
 LOGICAL NEXT STEP 
Mercedes-Benz started using camera-based systems in 2009, offering traffic-light recognition and lane-keeping assistance systems, switching to stereo cameras in 2013, to add depth of field and pedestrian recognition for emergency braking functions.
It was on a joint development project between the Tesla Model S and the Mercedes-Benz electric B-Class that Tesla s CEO, Elon Musk, learned about camera and radar-based assistance systems, senior engineers familiar with the project told Reuters.
Mercedes plans to launch Drive Pilot next year and is pitching it as an evolution of its Distronic system, launched in 2013, which uses cameras and radar to keep cars in lane and at a distance to the car in front.
Drive Pilot will add a new sensor: Lidar, to cross-reference data gathered by radar, ultrasonic sensors, high-definition mapping, radar and cameras.
""It is a paradigm change from Distronic, but it is a strategic evolution. For us this is the logical next step and it is not shooting for the moon,"" said Michael Decker, manager of automated driving at Mercedes-Benz Cars, while standing on the sidelines of the company s testing campus in Immendingen, where the Mercedes hones autonomous driving systems.
Decker, behind the wheel of the new S-Class, drives the car on to a stretch of road mocked up to replicate an autobahn and selects Drive Pilot. The car glides seamlessly, providing gentle braking and steering inputs to keep its place in moving traffic.
""I spend most of my time dealing with edge cases, those special situations that we need to have under control,"" he said. The Mercedes Drive Pilot will only work at up to 60 kilometers an hour, and reach higher speeds once the legal framework allows.
It will function only on highways in Germany from mid-next year onward, if a new law is passed.
""If the car crosses the border into France, it will disengage, because we use high-definition mapping as one of our validation systems, and France has not created the legal framework for allowing this system to operate,"" Decker said.
Although Mercedes engineers are aware of Tesla s more aggressive approach to marketing their systems, they appear unruffled.
""Yes. We always followed this path. And we now see that we have the right strategy,"" Decker said.
""What is paramount here is safety. This is about having a mature system. Mercedes safety standards stand over and above everything, including speed."""

On the one hand, there is the fear of missing out on more returns in the equity market. On the other, is elevated anxiety about the outcome and aftermath of the election and what that will do to their portfolios. Those are among the key takeaways from our recent survey of Investopedia readers, the fifth we have conducted since before the coronavirus was named a global pandemic.  Caught in the Neutral Zone  While our readers are slightly less bullish than they were in August, they are also slightly less bearish than they were in the summer. Since then, economies have opened up and growth is strong across most industries – although the labor market remains compromised – yet the virus is still very present in everyday life. Equity markets have trudged higher after rebounding out of the fastest bear market in history, and that has caused some concerns about stretched valuations in some stocks and sectors.  The Election is the Overhang  The upcoming election remains the dominant concern among our readers. While they are split on who they think will win the election, they remain concerned about the impact it will have on their portfolios. They are also concerned about what will happen in the aftermath of the election and whether it will be contested and peaceful.  Staying the Course  Despite their worries, only one quarter of our survey respondents, who range in age and income across the U.S., are making changes to their portfolios. Most are sticking with the stocks and strategies that have carried them through this tumultuous year. Their favorite stocks (listed below) show that they have chosen wisely and safely.  Of those who are making portfolio changes, older investors are becoming more conservative. They are moving more into cash and sticking with many of the same blue chip dividend-paying stocks they’ve held for years. Younger investors have also stayed loyal to their favorite stocks, while both younger and older investors still favor the technology and health care sectors.  Too Far, Too Fast?  62% of our survey respondents, regardless of age, think the stock market has become overvalued. 71% believe that the economy and the stock market are disconnected and 54% anticipate it could experience another significant drop in the next three months. The reasons for that are as described: The election, its aftermath, and the possibility of another economic shutdown.  They are also slightly concerned about President Trump’s use of social media as a communications tool and its impact on the stock market, as well as his health and the health of his administration. We fielded the survey just as the president tested positive for COVID-19 and was subsequently hospitalized.  Investors Keep the Faith in Their Favorite Stocks  Our readers have proven to be faithful investors when it comes to their portfolios. The top 10 holdings have remained fairly consistent throughout the pandemic, although there is variation among the different age groups of our readers. But the top three holdings – Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) – are also among the most widely held stocks in index funds, ETFs, hedge funds, endowments, and among retail investors.  Older investors have held onto their favorite dividend paying stocks like Bank of America (BAC) and Verizon (VZ), as well as traditional media companies like Disney (DIS). Tesla (TSLA) investors are nothing if not loyal and they have stuck with the electric car maker through many peaks and valleys, although 2020 has mostly been peaks.  What’s Next?  The next few months are a big question mark for investors. The election is the obvious elephant in the room, but beyond that, the resurgence of the virus and another potential lockdown, concerns about social unrest, and the widening disconnect between the capital markets and the economy will cloud the horizon. Individual investors, like our readers, have different time horizons and goals for investing than institutional investors. They can mostly afford to be patient until the smoke clears on any one or all of those issues. Until then, expect them to stay in the neutral zone."

9,2020-10-27,15:27:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-einhorn-says-tech-stocks-174728557.html,David Einhorn Says Tech Stocks Are in an Enormous Bubble,"(Bloomberg) -- Investor David Einhorn said technology stocks are in an “enormous” bubble and he has added a set of short wagers to profit from it.
“The question at hand is where are we in the psychology of this bubble?” the head of hedge fund Greenlight Capital wrote in an Oct. 27 note, seen by Bloomberg. “Our working hypothesis, which might be disproven, is that September 2, 2020 was the top and the bubble has already popped. If so, investor sentiment is in the process of shifting from greed to complacency.”
Tech stocks have driven the market’s rally this year. The Nasdaq 100 Index is up 33% since Jan. 1, led by gains in Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Tesla Inc. By contrast, the S&P 500 has risen 5.3%.
As signs of a bubble, Einhorn points to a mania in IPOs, a huge market concentration in a small group of stocks or a single sector, extraordinary valuations and “incredible” trading volumes in speculative instruments.
As a result, Greenlight has adjusted the portfolio of companies its wagering against by adding a fresh so-called bubble basket of mostly “second-tier companies and recent IPOs trading at remarkable valuations,” he wrote. Einhorn has long held what he calls a bubble basket of short wagers which have included tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc.
A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.
This isn’t the first time Einhorn has flagged a tech bubble. In early 2016, he “prematurely identified what we thought was a bubble,” he wrote in the letter.
It’s been a difficult road for Greenlight recently. The fund is down 16.1% through September, and has been trying to recoup losses that began in 2015. As of Jan. 1, the firm managed $2.6 billion, down from a peak of $12 billion.
Other highlights from the letter:
The coming election may rank “among the most perilous times, absent war, in modern American history.” A “tempest” of troubles related to the Covid pandemic -- including inequities, violence and calls for social change -- could explode after the election, no matter which side wins.The fund started “medium-sized” long positions in information technology company Synnex Corp., Austrian sensor maker AMS AG, and ATM-manufacturer NCR Corp.While a few Greenlight employees are working from the firm’s New York offices, which have been open since late summer, most of the staff continues to work from home, he said.

The company also produces solar panels and batteries, designs computer chips, and writes self-driving software.
Now the company is looking to help lower electric rates for customers with a new Energy Plan in the United Kingdom.
In a report covered on Teslarati, it looks like Tesla is going to work with local company Octopus Energy to help distribute its new energy plan. Tesla s new energy plan is going to offer a rate of 8p(pence)/kWh to Tesla vehicle owners and 11p/kWh for non-owners. This can be almost 50% lower than the average rate of 14.40p/kWh in the UK, although rates vary by location.
The energy plan will work with Tesla s solar products including solar panels and Powerwall. Tesla lists benefits such as helping the environment, reducing energy bills, and protection from power outages.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: PACCAR Inc PCAR, Genuine Parts Company GPC, Tesla, Inc. TSLA, General Motors Company GM and Harley-Davidson, Inc. HOG.
Last week, the third-quarter earnings season for the auto sector kicked off. So far this earnings season, just two S&P stocks from the auto sector, namely PACCAR and Genuine Parts, came up with quarterly numbers. Various other auto firms including the red-hot electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla, auto retailers namely Lithia Motors, Penske Automotive and AutoNation. Encouragingly, all the above-mentioned companies managed to deliver earnings beat. 
Meanwhile, U.S. auto giant General Motors grabbed limelight as it continues to step up its EV game. The firm announced plans to spend $2 billion to convert the Tennessee assembly plant to manufacture green vehicles. It also unveiled the first look of 2022 GMC Hummer EV sport utility truck. On the contrary, Harley-Davidson recalled more than 1,000 LiveWire bikes in the United States.
(Read the Last Auto Stock Roundup here).
1. Tesla reported stellar results for third-quarter 2020, posting profit for the fifth consecutive quarter. The company reported earnings of 76 cents, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents per share. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago earnings of 37 cents a share. Total revenues came in at $8,771 million, surpassing the consensus mark of $8,225 million. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 39%.
Tesla has maintained the target of 500K deliveries for full-year 2020. Importantly, the firm generated free cash flow of $1,395 million during the quarter. The metric compared favorably with $418 million and $371 million recorded in the prior quarter and the year-ago period, respectively. (Tesla Q3 Earnings Beat,  20 Delivery Target Intact)
2. General Motors recently announced the decision to invest $2 billion in its Spring Hill, TN assembly plant. This will facilitate the transition of the assembly plant to become the company’s third vehicle production facility for manufacturing electric vehicles (EV).Its two existing EV manufacturing plants are Factory Zero in Detroit and Hamtramck, MI, and Orion Assembly in Orion Township, MI.
The new luxury Cadillac LYRIQ will be the first EV to be manufactured at Spring Hill, along with the conventional combustion engine-powered Cadillac XT6 and XT5 luxury SUV crossovers, making the plant at Spring Hill not 100% electric, unlike the Factory Zero and Orion Assembly plants.

3. Harley-Davidson recently issued a voluntary safety recall for certain 2020 LiveWire electric motorcycles due to a potential software defect. Per National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall has been issued due to reports that a few of the 2020 LiveWire motorcycles have electric powertrains that unexpectedly initiate a shutdown without providing a clear notification to the rider that the shutdown sequence has started.
In some cases, the vehicle does not restart after the sudden shutdown due to a software defect in the Onboard Charging system.It is estimated that about 1,012 bikes have been recalled by the company for a software update in lieu of customers’ interests and safety.

* INSG nickel market balances: https://tmsnrt.rs/3jw7CXW
By Andy Home
LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) nickel price last week touched a year-to-date high of $16,135 per tonne.
Nickel bulls would love to believe this is all about rising usage in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The EV story has generated a tangible buzz in the nickel market over the last two years with Tesla s Elon Musk recently fanning the flames with his call for more mines to meet demand for electrification.
However, the reality is that the recent rally is much more about that most traditional of price drivers, namely the supply of nickel ore to China s giant stainless steel sector.
Such old-school dynamics are going to push the global market into a period of over-supply this year and next, according to the latest forecasts from the International Nickel Study Group (INSG).
The EV narrative, for now at least, is stuck in the slow lane.
ALL ABOUT ORE
The key metric to understanding the recent nickel price rally is the cost of nickel ore, according to analysts at Citi.
The Philippines has emerged as the main supplier of raw material to China s nickel pig iron (NPI) producers since Indonesia banned exports at the start of this year.
The price of medium-grade Philippine ore has doubled over the course of this year to a current $74 per tonne, according to Chinese research house Custeel.
That in turn feeds directly into higher costs for the NPI producers that supply China s stainless steel mills.
The Indonesian ore ban is reaching ""its climax"" with Chinese stocks falling to ""critical levels"" and the Philippines heading into the monsoon season, which limits mining activity, Citi said.
The bank has a ""bull-case"" price target of $17,000 per tonne in the fourth quarter of this year but ""from these highs we would be ready to flip cautious-bearish.""
That s because China s NPI production is declining as the supply chain migrates to Indonesia, which implemented its ore ban to force miners to upgrade to value-added products such as NPI.
This year ""likely marks the last year when China will produce more NPI than Indonesia,"" agrees JPMorgan.
The transition will see flows of Indonesian NPI become the dominant trade for Chinese stainless production.
Philippine ore prices will likely revert back to historical norms of around $35 per tonne which ""will depress costs of marginal Chinese NPI smelters to around $13,000/t, thus removing the cost support for spot nickel prices,"" JPMorgan said. (""Metals Weekly"", Oct. 26 2020)
SURPLUS AHEAD
Such traditional nickel price drivers, particularly the strength of global stainless steel output, will dominate the market for a while yet.
Global output of stainless steel fell by 9.4% in the first half of this year and will fall over the year as a whole despite a rebound in China, the INSG said.
Next year should be a year of recovery but by how much is very uncertain outside of China, where the consensus is for this year s V-shaped recovery to level out.
Global nickel production, by contrast, has been relatively unscathed by the lockdowns that have hit other industrial metals and will grow strongly next year as Indonesia s reconfigured nickel production sector ramps up.
The INSG now sees world output of primary metal at 2.436 million tonnes this year, a marginal 40,000-tonne reduction from the Group s last forecast in October 2019. Production growth will accelerate from 2.3% this year to 6.2% next year.
The Group therefore expects the refined nickel market to register supply surpluses of 117,000 tonnes this year and another 68,000 tonnes in 2021.
These will be the first years of excess supply since 2015.
EV SLOW LANE
What then of nickel s EV story?
It seems to be losing some of its traction, according to LME broker Marex Spectron.
Interest in nickel and electric vehicles peaked early in October and ""has reversed noticeably since then"", according to what the company calls its ""Nowcast"", a series of algorithms that trawl the web to monitor around a billion text documents per year for references between specific commodities and market themes.
""This begs the question of whether the recent reversal in EV Market Focus portends a declining interest in the key demand story for the metal,"" Marex said. (""Quantamental Update - Has the focus on EV as a key nickel demand driver peaked?"", Oct. 26, 2020).
This might seem counter-intuitive given all the headlines generated by Musk s call for more nickel mines.
But COVID-19 has laid low the entire automotive sector, even if EV production is bouncing back more strongly than conventional vehicles as governments prioritise ""green"" investment in their recovery plans.
Electric vehicles currently account for less than 5% of total nickel usage and the fear, to quote Macquarie Bank analysts, is the coronavirus will translate into ""two lost years for the electric vehicle market, pushing back the requirements for new nickel supply (...) all the way out to 2025.""
This theme of deferred expectations has been playing out across the battery metals space, witness this week s news that Australian hard-rock lithium miner Altura Mining has entered receivership due to low prices for its spodumene product.
Nickel s role in the EV revolution has also taken something of a dent from Tesla itself, which is using non-nickel batteries in its Model 3 cars in China. The switch to lithium-iron-phosphate batteries reduces costs but also reflects technical enhancements to a product that was regarded as legacy technology just a year ago.
It is becoming clear that battery design is not going to be a binary competition such as the much-cited 1980s battle between Betamax and VHS in video-taping. Rather, multiple technologies will co-exist to feed a differentiated global market for vehicle functionality.
This is not to say that EVs won t be a critical component of the nickel market going forwards, just that the relationship between sales growth and nickel usage may not be as linear as previously thought.
Nickel bulls may have to defer their great EV expectations for a while yet and focus on what is happening in the currently far more significant stainless steel sector. If the INSG is right, it could be a bumpy ride."

Xilinx (XLNX) was a big mover on the Nasdaq after Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced plans to buy the firm for $35 billion.  X  Xilinx stock jumped 11% on the news, while AMD stock gave back 2%. The deal will help AMD expand its data center business. The acquisition was part of AMD s Q3 earnings report, which showed a 56% jump in revenue to $2.8 billion. Adjusted earnings soared 128% to 41 cents a share.  After losing support at the 50-day moving average Monday, the Dow Jones industrials edged lower by 0.2%.

14,2020-10-27,10:25:00,TSLA,https://www.barrons.com/articles/alphabet-is-reporting-earnings-thursday-heres-how-to-play-it-with-options-51603808742?siteid=yhoof2,Alphabet Is Reporting Earnings Thursday. Heres How to Play It With Options.,"Text size  It is generally accepted fact among options strategists that there are 50/50 odds on betting on corporate earnings. An investor can be equally wrong or right that a stock will rise or fall when it releases earnings.  It is also a generally accepted fact that the odds can be better monetized—and even tilted to favor long-term investors—with a strategy that often favors aggressive investors with meaningful resources.  Selling options can be lucrative, especially around events like earnings that inflate puts and calls with fear or greed premiums in anticipation of the event’s conclusion. After an earnings report is released, for instance, implied volatility—which is the essence of an options price—tends to decline, meaning anyone who sold an option benefits.  Part of the allure of selling options is that the strategy is largely powered by an investor’s willingness to buy or sell a stock rather than on any short-term outlook.  Moreover, this particular earnings season also seems to favor options sellers. Investors seem distracted by the U.S. presidential election, Covid-19, and the prospect of another economic stimulus package. Stocks are often failing to move as much as priced by the options market. Examples of the muted moves include Netflix (ticker: NFLX), Verizon Communications (VZ), Tesla (TSLA), and Coca-Cola (KO), according to research from Shawn Quigg, a J.P. Morgan derivatives strategist.  Despite so many high-profile examples of stocks moving less than implied by options volatility, it is a cold, hard fact that trading around earnings is aggressive. Stocks may or may not make a strong move when the report is released. If the potential volatility is too much for you, wait until after earnings to sell options. Once the big news release is out of the way, stocks often behave with less vigor—and that also favors options-selling strategies. Some investors even prefer post-earnings trading because they think the odds are more likely to produce profits, given that stocks are less likely to make any sharp moves.  Consider Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), which is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings Thursday evening. The stock is priced in the options market as if it will move 4% up or down until the Friday expiration.  Anyone interested in trading Alphabet around earnings should focus on puts and calls that are 10% to 15% above or below the stock price, which was recently around $1,580, and on expirations of 30 to 45 days.  Selling a put expresses a willingness to buy the stock at the put strike price. The short call—a strategy that is likely best for someone who owns the stock and doesn’t mind selling at a higher price—expresses a willingness to sell the stock at the call strike price. (Call options give the holder the right to buy an asset at a set price and period, while puts give the holder the right to sell an asset at a set price and period.)  The big headwind for Alphabet’s earnings report is the federal government’s antitrust investigation into the company’s Google search engine. Investors will look for some insight from the company, which may or may not be shared after at the same time as the earnings report.  If the tenor of the earnings report, or comments on pending litigation, are really important to you, don’t consider the options-selling strategies before earnings, when the chance of a stock move is elevated. But if you can live with risk of trading an event like earnings, then selling options reflects confidence in the long-term viability of the company, either in its current firm, or in a post-antitrust form that could see the companies broken up into subsidiaries. A politicized Justice Department may challenge Alphabet, but it unlikely that anything can be done that will meaningfully harm investors.  Just look at Goldman Sachs Group (GS), which was fined $2.9 billion by the Justice Department for conspiring to bribe Malaysian officials to underwrite bonds and other business for the 1Malaysia Development Bhd. In July, Goldman also paid $2.5 billion to Malaysia to settle charges. What happened on the U.S. settlement news? The stock advanced because the bad news was defined and out of the way—and life goes onward.  The litigation threat may be bumpy for Alphabet, but the company is likely to remain an unusually valuable enterprise. After all, people will always search the internet.  Email: editors@barrons.com"

In fact, that ill-fated wager owns the crown of “worst short call” of the past five years, beating out other notable short-slayers like Apple AAPL, +1.34% and Amazon AMZN, +2.47% .  Of course, not all shorts have been caught on the wrong side of the technology leaders of this bull run. Plenty have managed to cash in on the struggles of some of the market’s biggest names in 2020.  Topping the list of winners for those who bet on falling stocks, according to S3 Partners data cited by the ValueWalk blog, is oil giant ExxonMobil XOM, -1.58% , which has delivered mark-to-market profits of $1.7 billion so far this year for short sellers. Rising crude inventories and dropping oil prices have been a gift to short-sellers, as the stock has lost more than half its value so far this year. It didn’t help that ExxonMobil lost its status as a Dow component.  Next up, AT&T T, -1.68% , the telecom company which has been bogged down with a hefty debt load, job cuts, asset sales and disappointing numbers for its pay TV platforms. Music to the shorts’ ears, as they’ve enjoyed mark-to-market profits of more than $1.5 billion.  Rounding out the list of the top five best shorts in 2020 are Wells Fargo WFC, -3.87% and Simon Property Group SPG, -4.17% , both delivering more than $1.3 billion in profits for shorts, and Raytheon RTX, -7.03% , which has resulted in a $1.2-billion win."

The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 43.7 million Tuesday, with more than 1.16 million virus-related deaths.  Coronavirus Stock Market Rally  According to IBD s The Big Picture, the coronavirus stock market rally is starting to falter amid recent institutional selling.  Monday s Big Picture commented that ""Sellers washed over the stock market Monday, dimming last week s hopeful signs and forcing a rethink of the market s outlook.""  This means investors need to turn much more cautious, but not go entirely to cash. Watch sell signals closely. Be sure to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price, and maybe even 3% or 4% if you want to raise cash.  Avoid buying stocks for now, unless the breakout is exceptionally good. The best candidates are those that proved most resilient during the recent stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with strong relative strength lines. These ideas could become stock market leaders.  Use MarketSmith features like the RS Line Blue Dot to easily spot such stock candidates.

Stock Market ETF Strategy And How To Invest In The New Uptrend  Dow Jones Earnings: Caterpillar  Among the Dow Jones stocks, Caterpillar beat views in the third quarter in which key markets saw a strong pandemic recovery. Caterpillar earnings came in at $1.34 a share as revenue slid 22% to $9.9 billion. Despite the better-than-expected results, CAT stock fell 3%.  Shares are extended from a 146.30 buy point in a cup with handle.  Stocks On The Move: Chegg, Twilio  Education leader Chegg topped third-quarter forecasts late Monday and gave strong guidance for the rest of this year and next year. But the stock still tumbled 10% Tuesday.  Chegg stock is forming a cup base with an 89.92 buy point, and the current weakness could lead to a new handle.  Twilio lost 1% early Tuesday after the company s earnings guidance came in below estimates. Earnings and revenue for the quarter beat expectations as demand for the company s communications software rose amid the coronavirus emergency.  Twilio stock ended Monday extended past a 283.44 buy point in a double bottom. Shares staged a powerful breakout on Oct. 2.  AMD-Xilinx Deal  AMD announced early Tuesday its deal to acquire Xilinx. The $35 billion, all-stock deal is expected to close at the end of 2021. The company also reported earnings on Tuesday.

According to IBD Leaderboard commentary, ""JD.com s latest base comes after the China leader broke out powerfully during the week ended Aug. 21.

Hot IPO stock JFrog is trying to break out past a 90.90 buy point in an IPO base. Shares briefly topped the buy point on Monday, but reversed lower amid the stock market sell-off.

Tesla Tests Key Support Level  Tesla stock remains at its 50-day line for the first time since Sept. 24. Shares are searching for support at this key level that could propel Tesla above a new 466 buy point in a handle.

17,2020-10-27,09:01:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yes-tesla-beat-earnings-yes-130131829.html,"Yes, Tesla Beat Earnings  and Yes, Tesla Stock Is Still a Sell, Says Analyst","For a day that marked Tesla s (TSLA) fifth straight quarter of reporting positive profits, last week s 0.7% increase in the share price of Tesla stock seemed somewhat underwhelming.
Reporting earnings Wednesday night, Tesla closed trading Thursday up only modestly, and really, only barely outperforming the S&P 500 s overall 0.5% move. Tesla called Q3 its ""best quarter in history,"" with pro forma earnings coming in 36% ahead of expectations at $0.76 per share, sales of $8.8 billion about 6% better than predicted, and free cash flowing strongly -- $1.9 billion over the past 12 months.
Tesla told investors Wednesday that it remains on target to produce and deliver half a million electric cars this year, despite the fact that ""this goal has become more difficult"" to achieve in the face of Covid-19. Cybertruck deliveries are expected to begin late next year. Even Tesla s ""energy"" business -- solar roofs and solar storage -- looks ""poised for strong growth,"" said the company.
Much of Wall Street applauded the news, with R.W. Baird and JMP Securities both upgrading Tesla shares to ""outperform"" and Piper Sandler calling Tesla a ""must-own"" stock, and as both Oppenheimer and RBC Capital raised price targets on the shares. One analyst, however, stood out from the crowd for his continued pessimism on Tesla:
Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research says Tesla is still a ""sell.""
Urging investors not to forget the forest for the trees, Johnson reminds Elon Musk fans that Tesla continues to rely heavily upon taxpayer-funded subsidies in the form of tax credits for the production of zero-emission vehicles (ZEV). With automotive giants such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Volkswagen all ramping up their own sales of electric cars, though, soon they will not need to buy ZEV credits from Tesla to hit their fuel efficiency targets set by California and other ""green"" states. And this could become a problem for Tesla, says Johnson, because the sale of ZEV credits continues to make up literally all of money that has kept Tesla s profits positive these past five quarters.
Ultimately, the 100%-profit revenues generated from the sale of ZEV credits will disappear, warns Johnson, noting that ""TSLA, itself, describes credit sales as non-recurring in nature."" Although the analyst admits that Tesla s gross margins have grown nicely, hitting 25% in the third quarter even discounting the effect of ZEV credit sales, trouble emerges a bit closer to the bottom line. Johnson notes that the company remains GAAP unprofitable but for the effect of ZEV credits. Back them out, and Tesla would have lost $97 million in Q3. Indeed, back them out and... ""TSLA hasn’t been profitable ...since 3Q19.""
Of course, Tesla is famously viewed by investors as a growth stock. So isn t it possible Tesla can just grow its way out of this problem? Sell more cars, and become so profitable that it no longer needs ZEVs?
Maybe. But Johnson isn t optimistic.
From Q2 2020 to Q3 2020, Tesla has grown its ability to produce cars to a stated capacity of 840,000 vehicles per year. Despite the added capacity, however, Tesla is only predicting that it might sell 500,000 cars this year. This seems to speak to a lack of demand for the product even at present production levels, and in Johnson s view, this lack of demand explains why Tesla has cut its prices ""now 13 times in 2020 alone.""
Conclusion: Johnson disagrees with those who call Tesla ""fairly valued"" or even ""undervalued"" at its current P/E of more than 1,000 times trailing earnings. The analyst rates Tesla stock a sell, and continues to predict a 90% share price decline. (To watch Johnson s track record, click here)
Overall, Wall Street is not as bearish on TSLA as Johnson, but is not convinced on this stock, either. TSLA holds a Moderate Buy from the analyst consensus, based on 9 ""buy"" ratings – but also 9 ""holds"" and 9 ""sells."" Shares sell for $420.28, and the $378.39 average price target suggests a 10% downside from current levels. (See TSLA stock analysis on TipRanks)

Going from breaking ground at the beginning of 2019 to vehicle production less than a year later, the new factory has already become a critical component to Tesla s growth story. In fact, the factory is now producing so many cars that it is beginning to export vehicles to Europe instead of just making vehicles for the local market.  Here s a closer look at the factory s production capacity -- and how it has become imperative to the automaker s continued growth.  Shipping 7,000 Model 3s from China to Europe  When Tesla first announced its factory in China, the company said the factory would be built to ship vehicles within the China market. This has been true up until now.  A Chinese news website called The Paper reported Monday morning that Tesla is shipping about 7,000 Model 3 vehicles from the Chinese factory to Europe this week, highlighting how important the factory has become to Tesla s continued growth.  Investors first learned of Tesla s plans to start shipping vehicles from its Shanghai factory to other markets in September, when Bloomberg reported that the factory may have the capacity to ship vehicles to other Asian countries and to Europe.  Impressive production volumes  According to Tesla s third-quarter update, the Shanghai factory now has the installed production capacity to build 250,000 Model 3 units annually. This is up from a capacity of 200,000 in the prior quarter.  But Tesla s Shanghai factory may soon see another huge jump in vehicle production capacity, as the automaker is currently building out its Model Y production capacity at the factory.  During Tesla s third-quarter earnings call last week, management was unsurprisingly pleased with Tesla s progress in China.  ""Then in terms of capacity build out, we re making progress on three major factories,"" said CEO Elon Musk in the company s third-quarter shareholder letter.  Musk continued:  We re continuing to expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well. The Tesla China team is just, I mean, incredibly good. ... It s like I m always amazed by how much progress the Tesla China team makes. It s beyond all reasonable expectations.  Shanghai isn t the only place Tesla is making big progress on production capacity. During Q3, Tesla s annual production capacity at its factory in Fremont, California increased by 100,000 vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla is also constructing Model Y production lines in Berlin and Texas."

TOKYO (Reuters) - A joint battery venture of Toyota Motor Corp and Panasonic Corp aims to boost efficiency of development and production processes by 10 times to better compete with larger Chinese rivals, its chief said on Tuesday.
The venture, Prime Planet Energy & Solutions Inc, is now the world s largest supplier of batteries for hybrid vehicles, and was created in April by pooling part of the battery-related equipment and engineers of the two firms.
But it has a share of only 3% in the high-capacity battery market for electric vehicles, lagging far behind China s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) with a share more than 20%.
Prime Planet is moving to standardise battery designs and helping streamline operations of materials suppliers, its president, Hiroaki Koda, told a news conference.
""With efficiency ten times higher, we can win over the Chinese,"" Koda added.
Toyota, which targets electrified vehicles to bring in half its global sales by 2025, has also partnered with CATL and Chinese EV maker BYD Co Ltd for battery procurement.
Koda declined to give a time frame for the efficiency target or the scale of consequent cost reduction, but said the company would probably improve by five to six times the next version of its product, now being worked on.
Asked about Tesla Inc s promise to halve battery costs over the next several years with new technology and processes, Koda said Prime Planet had similar plans regarding technology.
""Tesla publicly announced that, so it means they will do it,"" said Koda, a former procurement executive at Toyota. ""I respect that.""
Prime Planet has taken over Panasonic s business in thin, rectangular-shaped prismatic batteries, while Panasonic retained its business with Tesla for cylindrical batteries of a type similar to those used in laptops."

21,2020-10-27,03:03:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-reports-improved-miles-accidents-070328702.html,Tesla Reports Improved Miles-To-Accidents Ratio For Autopilot,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has released its “Vehicle Safety Report” for the third-quarter that contains figures related to accidents per mile involving the automaker’s vehicles with autopilot engaged and disengaged. 
What Happened: In Q3, the Elon Musk-led company registered one accident for every 4.59 million miles where drivers engaged the Autopilot, as per the report. 
In case the Autopilot wasn’t engaged, data indicates there was one accident for every 1.79 million miles driven.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration numbers indicate that there is one crash for every 479,000 miles driven in the United States, Tesla said in the report. 
Why It Matters: The latest numbers are an improvement over the same period last year, where, with the Autopilot engaged, there was one accident for every 4.34 million miles driven. Without the Autopilot engaged, there was one accident for every 1.82 million miles driven. 
Tesla also provided data for drivers that engaged active safety features, but not the Autopilot, which indicated some deterioration in safety. 
In Q3, there was one accident for every 2.42 million miles driven, while in a similar period a year earlier, there was one accident for every 2.70 million miles driven in cases only safety features were engaged and not the Autopilot.
Tesla began voluntarily releasing quarterly vehicle safety data in October 2018. 
The EV maker has made available its full-self driving software this month for beta testing and is taking a slow and cautious approach with its rollout.
Price Action: Tesla shares traded 0.9% lower at $416.50 in the after-hours session on Monday after closing mostly unchanged at $420.28.

Tesla Ends Controversial Indemnification Agreement With Elon Musk
Geely Plans To Make 30,000 Polestar EVs Annually At New China Plant: Report"
22,2020-10-26,23:55:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-ends-controversial-indemnification-agreement-035508740.html,Tesla Ends Controversial Indemnification Agreement With Elon Musk,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) has ended a controversial practice where it paid its CEO Elon Musk to provide Directors and officers (D&O) liability insurance, the electric vehicle maker revealed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
What Happened: The automaker said it paid Musk $3 million for 90 days worth of coverage — up to a total of $100 million — but didn t further extend the agreement.
""Following the lapse of the 90-day period, we did not extend the term of the indemnification agreement with our CEO and instead bound a customary directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with third-party carriers,"" Tesla said in a statement.
The Palo Alto-based company didn t reveal which carrier it has opted for to provide coverage, or the premium it was paying for the D&O policy.
Why It Matters: It is “highly unusual” for a company to replace a D&O policy with a guaranty from a company officer “for any period of time,” Kevin Hirzel, a managing member of the Detroit-based Hirzel Law firm, told CNBC, which earlier reported the news.
“Tesla’s board did the right thing in obtaining a traditional directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy from a third-party insurer,” said Hirzel.
Charles Elson, a professor of corporate governance, said that the personal indemnification by a CEO “linked the directors too closely to the CEO.”
“Such a linkage would make it more difficult for board members to exercise good oversight on behalf of all shareholders,” Elson told CNBC.
Price Action: Tesla shares traded 0.9% lower at $416.50 in the after-hours session Monday after closing mostly unchanged at $420.28.

24,2020-10-26,16:48:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-earnings-could-turn-204808829.html,Big Tech Earnings Could Turn The Equity Market's Tide,"Earnings season is reaching its climax, and we have already had some exciting price action so far. Big Tech has been this year s most prominent market drivers, and its grandiose 2020 returns are being put to the test once again.
This week of major earnings reports leads up to one of the most controversial elections in US history, while a global pandemic picks back up and economic risk swells. This rising anxiety has some investors on the run, pulling profits where they can. Let s take a look at this week s action and what to expect from this week s big hitters.
Last Week s Recap
Last week we had some mixed results from our tech powerhouses. Last week, Netflix NFLX released highly anticipated earnings on Tuesday, disappointing investors after illustrating weaker than expected subscription growth. NFLX shares have tumbled 8% since, as investors and traders pull profits. Still, the shares remain up 49% for the year.
Tesla TSLA just released its Q3 earnings with record figures on effectively every metric. The innovation-driven automaker just recorded its 5th consecutive profitable quarter.
Elon Musk and his automotive giant are finally keeping their ostentatious promises. Elon promised half a million cars delivered by the end of 2020, and the company might just be able to pull it off.
In the face of a global pandemic and economic recession, Tesla was able to deliver a record number of EVs. The enterprise is looking at a very bright future, and it seems that every quarter TSLA s seemingly lofty valuation is further justified.
Tesla s Shanghai Gigafactory was a success, and its Berlin Gigafactory is set to start production next summer. Tesla is undoubtedly going to be a major automotive driver in the Roaring 20s.
What to Expect This Week
5 out of the top 6 largest companies in the world are reporting this week, and this could catalyze some sizable market-moving action.
Tech has faltered since the beginning of September as the pre-election jitters begin to impress fear into investment/trading decisions. The 3 largest world tech giants: Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon AMZN, have all dipped below their 50-day and will be looking towards their 200-day moving averages for support if this week s results add to the selling pressure.
Below are the critical tech earnings to look forward to this week, along with Zacks Consensus estimates.
Levels to Watch
The markets are really taking a tumble today as COVID-19 cases surge over the weekend to record levels. Investors and traders are worried that this second pandemic wave will send another financially devastating shockwave through the economy.
MSFT is down over 3% today, once again dipping below its 50-day moving average (blue line), which sits at $212.50. The next big support level, if the shares continue down through its September quarter earnings, is around $190, which represents the 200-day moving average (red line) as well as the stock s pre-pandemic highs.
AAPL is down marginally today and is in a similar position to MSFT, having dropped below its 50-moving average (blue line) and is moving lower. The support level to watch out for here is $100 per share, which I have circled in red. If it breaks below this level, watch out for its 200-day moving average of around $90 per share to support the stock.
AMZN has been trading sideways since the beginning of July, stuck in a trading rut between $2,900 and $3,500 per share. The stock has fallen below its 50-day moving average (blue) and is looking towards Thursday s results to push the shares back into growth. AMZN is trading at $3,190 and will be looking at the $3,100 level for support (circled). Analysts are anticipating record figures from the e-com and cloud giant. Let s see if this tech behemoth can deliver.
Final Thoughts 
If these three tech pioneers make it down to their 200-day moving averages, I will not hesitate to buy. There is an enormous amount of uncertainty in the markets with a record daily COVID cases and maybe one of the US s most contentious elections a week away. I would be cautious in purchasing any stocks going into earnings this week.

As Tom recalls, ""He looked at me and he said,  I don t know, I just learned. Don t bet against my brother. ""  Tesla short-sellers are learning that the hard way (again) after Tesla shattered analysts  expectations for the company s third quarter results, which were released on Oct. 21 after market close. Here s what investors need to know.  By the numbers  Metric Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q3 2019 YOY % Change Revenue $8.8 billion $6.0 billion $6.3 billion 39% Net Income $331 million $104 million $143 million 131% Adjusted EPS* $0.76 $0.44 $0.37 105% Operating Cash Flow $2.4 billion $964 million $756 million 217% Free Cash Flow $1.4 billion $418 million $371 million 276%  Those are impressive numbers, made even more impressive by the fact that they re being posted in the midst of a U.S. recession during which there are fewer drivers on the roads. When 39% revenue growth is the lowest percentage gain in your marquee figures, you know it s at least a good report. For Tesla, the third quarter wasn t just good: it was record-setting.  Quarterly revenue set a new record high for the company, at $8.8 billion, which was expected due to the company s strong delivery numbers. Another record is the $331 million in quarterly net income, which surpassed Tesla s previous milestone of $311 million, set in third quarter 2018. For me, the most jaw-dropping figure is Tesla s $2.4 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter, which is nearly double its previous quarterly record, set in fourth quarter 2017.  Despite the company s outperformance -- EPS topped analysts  consensus estimates by $0.20/share -- shares closed up less than 1% from the previous day s close. This could indicate that the expectation of big growth is already priced into the lofty valuation of Tesla s stock.  What Musk had to say  CEO Elon Musk, never one to understate his successes, started the earnings call by telling it the way he saw it: ""All right. So, Q3 was our best quarter in history.""  He highlighted the company s other initiatives, including the incremental advances in battery technology that Tesla showcased at its Battery Day, the beta release of Full Self-Driving mode, the continued buildout of the company s manufacturing capabilities, and a projected increase in sales of Solar Roof, which he referred to as a ""killer product.""  He also doubled down on the company s stated goal of continuing to cut prices:  If the car is too expensive... and people don t have enough money in their bank account, they simply can t buy it no matter what the value proposition is. So it is important to lower the prices. ... I do not think we lack for desire for our product, but we do lack for affordability.  The catch-22  Some analysts are concerned that, as the company grows sales of its lower-priced cars and pursues price cuts, it won t be able to maintain its double-digit margin target. CFO Zachary Kirkhorn agreed with Musk on the need for affordability, but didn t think it was mutually exclusive with margin growth:  If you just look at the journey of the company over the last 1.5 years, we have grown volumes and grown gross margins despite a number of price reductions over that period of time, and we have kept OpEx fairly stable during that period of time as well. We have to also continue to make progress improving the cost structure ... and improve the value of the vehicles at the same time. So in addition to reducing the cost of the car, we re making the cars better. And that s the formula to sell the volume. That s what we re focused on.  One way to do this, according to Musk, is to bring as much manufacturing in-house as possible. ""There s in excess of a dozen start-ups effectively in Tesla,"" Musk said, citing microchips, battery cells, superchargers, and autonomous driving as areas that other car companies outsource but Tesla doesn t. ""Tesla is absolutely vertically integrated compared to other auto companies or basically most any company,"" said Musk. ""We literally make the machine.""  ""Quite frankly, we would like to outsource less,"" concluded Musk. ""That would be great.""  What Q3 tells investors  The third quarter s strong performance indicates that Tesla has finally turned the corner when it comes to profitability and cash flow generation from its passenger cars.  Interestingly, Musk and his management team didn t even mention the Semi or Cybertruck until they were specifically asked about them by the analysts on the call. They only briefly mentioned the company s often-overlooked energy storage products, Powerwall and Megacell. The primary focus of the earnings call -- and the company -- is clearly on its passenger cars.  That s probably good news for investors, since Tesla s cars are in demand and selling well. Focusing on maximizing their profitability and improving their affordability is probably going to give Tesla the biggest bang for its buck in terms of improving the (already-much-improved) bottom line.  Tesla s sky-high valuation should give new investors pause, but operationally, it seems to be on solid footing, and its impressive growth streak seems likely to continue. I wouldn t place any bets against the company right now."
26,2020-10-26,13:51:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-raises-capex-guidance-plans-175118977.html,"Tesla Raises Capex Guidance, Plans Outlay Of Up To $12B Over 2 Years","Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) operates in a capital-intensive industry, and the electric vehicle giant is stepping up investment to maintain its lead over the competition.
What Happened:  Tesla s capex for fiscal year 2020 will likely come in at the high end of its guidance range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, the company revealed in a Monday 10-Q filing.
The revision is due to the ramping of new products, the  Model Y  and Solar Roof; the construction of manufacturing facilities on three continents; and  the development and manufacturing of  new battery cell technologies.
The hike in capex also takes into account the pipeline of announced projects under development and all other continuing infrastructure growth, Tesla said.
More importantly, Tesla said it expects capex to increase to $4.5 billion to $6 billion in fiscal 2021 and 2022.

The company expressed confidence in meeting the capital needs with its cash flow from operations.
Better working capital management — resulting in shorter days outstanding than days payable outstanding — and sales growth are facilitating positive cash generation, the automaker said. 
""We expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales,"" according to Tesla. 
Why It s Important: Chinese EV start-ups such as Nio Inc – ADR (NYSE: NIO), and Xpeng Inc – ADR (NYSE: XPEV) are going all out to innovate in order to give Tesla a run for its money.
Traditional automakers have also joined the party.
It becomes necessary for Tesla to invest in R&D and manufacturing to maintain technological superiority and over peers and to sustain its sales growth.
TSLA Price Action: At last check, Tesla shares were slipping 2.17% to $411.49.

28,2020-10-26,09:21:00,TSLA,https://www.investopedia.com/etsys-etsy-resilience-through-the-pandemic-and-beyond-5084061?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral,Etsy's (ETSY) Resilience Through the Pandemic and Beyond,"Etsy, Inc. (ETSY), an e-commerce platform beloved by craft enthusiasts everywhere, became one of the recent pandemic-era additions to the S&P 500 index.  Key Takeaways Etsy is due to report earnings on Oct. 28  Etsy s performance during the pandemic has been a result of its strategic positioning over the past 15 years as well as stumbles by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN).  In September, S&P Dow Jones Indices added Etsy to the S&P 500, removing H&R Block, Inc. (HRB), Coty Inc. (COTY), and Kohl s Corporation (KSS). Notably, the addition of Etsy, a Brooklyn-born crafts marketplace, came ahead of the anticipated addition of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) due to potential questions about Tesla s profitability. Morningstar s David Whiston told Fortune that ""stability of Tesla s earnings"" may be behind S&P s decision.  The share price of Etsy, which is reporting third quarter earnings on Oct. 28, is up significantly from below $50 at the start of the year before the outbreak of COVID-19. While 2020 has been brutal to a lot of retailers, Etsy has been weathering the pandemic remarkably well as more consumers are shopping online, spending time at home, and picking up new hobbies.  ""We view the pandemic as benefiting Etsy through an uptick in digital demand while also creating a window of opportunity to capture new customers looking to buy (COVID-19) masks,"" said Needham analyst Rick Patel. ""We believe Etsy is making good progress in retaining these customers, which should fuel future growth.""  While many retailers big and small have crashed since the rise of Amazon and eBay Inc. (EBAY), Etsy has stayed the course. In fact, 2020 may prove to be its biggest year yet. Etsy s performance in this pandemic is a result of its strategic positioning over the past 15 years – as well as Amazon s stumbles. In many ways, the core of Etsy s success is its mission to offer ""handcrafted and differentiated"" goods as well as allowing its visitors to browse and search for these unique products.  Come for the Masks, Stay for the Rest  In the second quarter, Etsy reported $356 million in mask sales, which the company described at the earnings call as ""enough masks to stretch all the way from New York to London."" The huge demand for face coverings also fueled non-mask sales, which jumped 93% in the same quarter, according to company data.  ""Most of the customers who go to Etsy for the first time in order to buy masks end up buying other products too, and many of them will remain on the platform going forward,"" according to Needham analysts.  Masks aside, Etsy s top category of homewares and home furnishings was up 128% compared to a year before. The sales of craft supplies jumped 138%, and jewelry and accessory sales were also up 50%. The ability to browse, search, and more recently to save searches for relevant products is one part of Etsy s appeal to its buyers and sellers. The company s gross profit margin is expanding – it was 74% in the second quarter, an increase of 640 basis points compared to 67.6% a year before.  Bigger Market  Etsy has performed so well in the past few months that the company is rethinking its addressable market. In 2019, Etsy estimated its target market at $100 billion, based on assumptions of the top six countries, separation of online and offline shopping experiences, and product differentiation.  ""In fact, COVID has helped to explode each of those three assumptions. Etsy competes in almost every market in the world, not just the core six. And in fact the distinction between online and offline has all (but) evaporated in the past few months,"" Josh Silverman, Etsy s CEO, said on the earnings call. ""When we pull back and look at what we ve learned over the past three months, it reinforces my belief that the size of Etsy s addressable market starts with a T not with a B. All of this gives us even more conviction about the size of the pricing that Etsy is changing and the opportunity to invest to fully realize that growth.""  Amazon Competition  Amazon will still likely dominate e-commerce ad spending, according to Insider Intelligence research. The firm projects Etsy s share of e-commerce ad spending to grow by nearly 70% to $133.2 million.  Amazon did launch Handmade in 2015, but so far it hasn t deterred Etsy s growth. With continued improvements to Etsy s machine learning and experimentation with augmented reality features, Etsy is poised to remain competitive across handmade categories.  Many small crafts sellers on Amazon continue to compete against its ""vast database of mass-produced merchandise,"" according to reporting by OneZero earlier this year. ""One Amazon Handmade seller said that, at times, she cannot find her own store using Amazon s search feature,"" the firm reported. Amazon is trying to change that, planning to improve search and discovery features, as reported by Business Insider.  Until then, Etsy is likely to continue to benefit from increased online engagement, growing ad spending on all e-commerce platforms, and deeper differentiation of its platform as a go-to marketplace for unique, handmade goods."

Chinese government-backed news outlet The Paper reports on Monday that Tesla will ship about 7,000 Model 3s from its Shanghai factory to a port in Belgium for delivery to customers in countries throughout Europe.  The ship carrying the Teslas will depart on Tuesday and is expected to arrive in late November, according to the report.  It s the first time that Tesla has exported vehicles from its factory in China. Shanghai s deputy mayor, Chen Yin, who spoke at a ceremony to mark the occasion on Monday, said that Tesla s Shanghai factory, which opened late last year, is now producing between 3,500 and 4,000 Model 3 sedans per week.  The company is in the process of building a second assembly line at the factory for the Model Y crossover SUV, Chen said.  Tesla s China chief, Zhu Xiotong, said that the Model 3s heading to Europe have the same battery life as its standard-specification Chinese-market models. The sedans have passed all of the European-market certification requirements, he said.  Tesla s factory in Shanghai is the first auto factory in China to be built by a global automaker outside of a joint venture with a domestic Chinese automaker. The factory, located in a special ""free trade zone"" in Shanghai, has become a point of pride for local politicians because of the speed of its construction: It took less than a year for the factory to go from groundbreaking to the start of production."

Tesla (TSLA) - Get Report on Tuesday reportedly will ship about 7,000 made-in-China electric cars to Europe.  Shares of the Palo Alto, Calif., automaker at last check were down 1.8% to $413.04.  The Model 3s were made at the company s Shanghai gigafactory, CNBC reported, citing a report in the China-backed outlet the Paper.  They are scheduled to arrive in Belgium at the end of next month, with planned deliveries to Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden and other countries.  The company said that Model 3 production capacity for the Shanghai factory, which opened a year ago, has reached 250,000 units a year.  Chinese regulators said last week that Tesla was recalling as many as 48,442 of its U.S.-made Model S and Model X cars that it sold to customers in China. That s due to potentially faulty and unsafe front and rear suspensions.  Separately, Tesla said in a regulatory filing that a fourth tranche of Tesla stock options will vest to Chief Executive Elon Musk upon certification that milestones laid out in his 2018 performance award have been achieved.  This month, the market capitalization milestone of $250 billion was achieved, and the operational milestone of annualized adjusted Ebitda of $4.5 billion will be achieved as of the issuance of Tesla’s Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q quarterly report.  Tesla said it expected that the remaining unamortized expense of $122 million associated with the fourth market-capitalization-milestone period will be accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2020. Tesla had expected to recognize that expense in quarters through third-quarter 2023.  The company in the filing said that as of and following September ""there has continued to be widespread impact to the global economy"" from the coronavirus pandemic.  ""We temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of 2020,"" the filing said.  Exiting first-half 2020, however, ""we have resumed operations at all of our manufacturing facilities, continue to increase our output and add additional capacity, and are working with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production,"" Tesla said.  Last week, Tesla reported third quarter results that topped analyst estimates."

It s a pivotal week for the stock market rally. Hopes for a pre-election stimulus deal are fading. It s the heart of earnings season, with Apple stock, and Microsoft (MSFT) among those reporting.  X  The market rally suffered further losses last week, but the major indexes and leading stocks found support and pared losses.  Wall Street is heading into the peak week of earnings. Along with Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft stock, Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), AMD (AMD), Shopify (SHOP), Twilio (TWLO), ServiceNow (NOW) among the hundreds of companies reporting. It s the last full week before the presidential election. New coronavirus cases are breaking records in the U.S. and Europe, but Covid vaccine news could come any day. And stimulus deal hopes and doubts remain.  All of this is taking place with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq at key levels. The major indexes and many leaders, such as Microsoft stock, Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Tesla (TSLA), could offer buying opportunities with a good day or two. But one or two bad sessions could trigger serious concerns about the stock market rally.  Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks  Leaderboard Stocks  Tesla, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce stock are all on IBD Leaderboard.  Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe stock also are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Unlike Apple and Amazon stock, which are not Long-Term Leaders, these three software giants are all holding above their 10-week moving averages. The 10-week line is a good place to buy Long-Term Leaders, but investors should wait to see a little more strength in these stocks, as well as the market rally. Microsoft earnings also loom.  Meanwhile, Tesla stock also has found support near its 10-week line, with buy points or sell signals not far away. It s hard to believe it, but the Tesla news cycle might quiet down for a time.  The Latest IBD/TIPP Trump Vs. Biden Tracking Poll  Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures fell 1.15% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.95%.  Along with the surge in coronavirus cases, stalled stimulus deal talks also could influence Dow Jones futures. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday blamed President Trump for the lack of a stimulus deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been stimulus deal talks with Pelosi, said the White House has offered compromises but the Speaker is ""dug in.""  The House is already out while the Senate will leave town on Monday, after the likely confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. While Congress could be called back to vote on a stimulus deal, that seems unlikely with election campaigns in the final stretch.  Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 GOP senator, said Sunday that he hopes a stimulus deal can be passed after the election.  Meanwhile, German software giant SAP (SAP) on Sunday cut its full-year revenue and operating profit forecasts, saying the coronavirus pandemic will hurt demand ""at least"" through mid-2021. SAP did beat Q3 profit views, though revenue missed.  SAP stock plunged roughly 20% in premarket trading.

Daily coronavirus cases worldwide are approaching half a million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.16 million.  Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 8.88 million, with deaths above 230,000.  Vice President Mike Pence s chief of staff Marc Short and political adviser Marty Obst have tested positive for the coronavirus. NBC News reported at two more Pence aides have tested positive for the coronavirus, while ABC News said a total of five people in the vice president s ""orbit"" have tested positive.  Pence, who has tested negative again, has decided not to quarantine and will continue campaigning.  The U.S. added 81,210 new coronavirus cases on Friday, a new daily record, followed by 79,449 on Saturday. That s partly due to increased testing from earlier in the year, but positive test results are rising sharply as well. Coronavirus restrictions have eased from earlier in the year, but the biggest factor may be Americans weary of following social distancing and mask rules.  Several European countries have been hitting daily records, with Spain and France now with more than one million Covid-19 cases in total. Much of Europe has reimposed tougher coronavirus restrictions, but not much in U.S. cities and states so far.  If coronavirus restrictions are reimposed, that could stall a relatively solid economic recovery. That would likely add pressure for a new stimulus deal.  Coronavirus death rates remain relatively low, reflecting better treatments and procedures and the lag between infection and fatalities. Hospitalizations for the coronavirus have risen sharply, however.  Coronavirus Vaccine News Soon?  Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) and partner BioNTech (BNTX) could release interim effectiveness data on their coronavirus vaccine candidate from final-stage trials any day, with a possible FDA approval request by late November. Moderna (MRNA) could follow a few weeks later.  In a best-case scenario, millions of coronavirus vaccine doses will be out before year-end, targeting those most at risk. But it would still take many months to vaccinate most Americans.  Both Pfizer and Moderna report earnings this coming week.  The AstraZeneca (AZN) Covid-19 vaccine reportedly produces a robust antibody and T-cell immune response in elderly people. The U.S. part of AstraZeneca s final-stage trial finally resumed Friday following a severe reaction by one participant.  A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine also has resumed late-stage trials after a brief pause over a participant s illness. The J&J Covid-19 vaccine candidate is one of the few that would require just a single dose.  Stock Market Rally Last Week  U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 28336.62 -27.04 -0.10 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3465.59 +12.10 +0.35 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 11548.28 +42.28 +0.37 Russell 2000 (IWM) 162.98 +0.85 +0.52 IBD 50 (FFTY) 38.33 +0.30 +0.79 Last Update: 4:04 PM ET 10/23/2020  The stock market rally continued to slide, though the major indexes all found support at their 21-day exponential moving averages.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9% in last week s stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite slid 1.1%, but held its ground after tumbling 1.65% on Monday.  Apple stock fell 3.3%, closing near weekly lows. Amazon sank 2.1%. Microsoft sank 1.6%, but has now risen for the past four sessions. Salesforce retreated 3.1%. Adobe fell back 2.85%, but rallied Friday to get just above its 10-week line. Tesla stock sank 4.3%.  Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 2.7%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) lost 1.3%, with Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe all major components. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 1.4%.  Long-Term Leaders Near Buy Points  A good time to buy Long-Term Leaders is near their 10-week moving averages. Dow Jones stocks Microsoft and Salesforce rebounded from their 10-week lines this week, while Adobe reclaims that key level Friday.  But you want to see these stocks decisively break short trend lines in their handles, with similar action in the major indexes. But if these stocks are moving decisively higher, the Nasdaq likely will show positive action as well.  In the case of Dow Jones giant Microsoft, investors should wait until after its Tuesday night earnings.  Microsoft and Adobe fell about 1% early Monday. Salesforce stock lost nearly 2%.  Tesla Stock  After trying to break past an early entry on Oct. 14, Tesla stock has retreated, undercutting its 50-day and 10-week line on Friday but closing above those line.  Especially n a weekly chart, TSLA stock looks fine. It s been consolidating relatively tightly over the past several weeks and is once again finding support at the 10-week line. It s also forged a handle with a 466 buy point. Aggressive investors could use 445.33, just above Thursday s intraday high, as an early entry.  On the other hand, if Tesla decisively breaks below its 10-week line, investors may want to consider paring gains.  Over the last couple of months, there were several expected catalysts for Tesla stock: S&P 500 inclusion, Battery Day, Q3 deliveries and Q3 earnings. S&P inclusion hasn t happened while the other there events didn t drive TSLA stock higher. Then again, they haven t sunk the stock either.  Tesla stock fell 2% early Monday.  Tesla News About To Get Boring?  No, that s not a reference to Tesla sister company Boring.  In the next few weeks, the Tesla news cycle may actually quiet down. Sure, there is plenty going on. Tesla is exporting Model 3 cars from its Shanghai plant to Europe, taking over somewhat for the Fremont, Calif., plant.  In a new SEC filing Monday, Tesla said it expects capital spending in 2020 to be at the high end of its target range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. Capex already picked up in Q3. It sees capex of $4.5 billion to $6 billion in 2021 and 2022.  Tesla could cut the Model 3 prices in the U.S. in the coming weeks, after recently slashing Model 3 prices in China and cutting Model S prices.  No doubt, Elon Musk and Tesla will keep themselves in the public eye. The Full Self Driving beta launch is getting a lot of attention, with Tesla raising the FSD price to $10,000 on Monday even as critics note the Level 2 system s shortcomings.  But on paper, Tesla has few key ""circle that date"" events over the last couple of months. The Model Y will soon launch in China, though perhaps not until the start of 2021. Meanwhile, the Ford Mustang Mach E, a Model Y competitor, will launch in the U.S. before year-even. The VW ID.4, another Model Y rival, will start global deliveries around the start of the year.  So all of those events, along with Tesla s Q4 deliveries, herald a new round of headlines and the beginning of a critical year for the electric car industry.  These 4 Stocks Are Trading Bullishly, Offering New Buy Points  Stock Market Analysis  Heading into last week, there were reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Sure, the major indexes had pulled back, a little, but that was allowing many tech giants to form handles.  Then on Monday, Oct. 19, the major indexes suffered sharp losses, with growth names harder hit. After a couple of modest days, stocks undercut their 21-day lines in Thursday s session, with the 50-day line not far past that. Thankfully, the major indexes rebounded for slim gains, followed by Friday s rally into the close.  Arguably, the stock market rally is a good day or two from looking bullish again. Breaking the short trend lines in the Nasdaq would be a positive sign. Then again, it would only take a day or two for the market rally to look bearish, testing or undercutting 50-day lines.  Dow Jones futures suggest that the major indexes will test or undercut their 21-day lines at Monday s open, with the Dow itself sinking to around its 50-day line.  Game Plan The Market Rally  Analyze your stocks. A lot of mixed action in growth names this week. You might have cut back your exposure but still grade your current holdings. Several of your stocks may have earnings due in the next few days. Do you have enough of a cushion heading into results?  Build up your watch lists. There are a lot of good-looking charts. Many just need one push, whether from individual earnings or broad market strength, to flash clear buying signals. So you want to be ready.  Let The Stock Market Trend Be Your Friend  But while the stock market rally hasn t done anything seriously wrong over the past two weeks, it hasn t been a good environment for making money.  Earnings season is usually enough chaos for your portfolio. But this headline-driven stock market rally has so headlines to deal with right now: the presidential election, coronavirus vaccine news, stimulus deal talks. Coronavirus cases are front-and-center once again. All could swing the market one way or the other in the next few weeks.  Don t get too exposed. Wait for the market to show clear positive direction. That could happen in the next few days or weeks. There will be many breakouts and other buying opportunities if the market takes off again. If market heads lower, new buys are likely to struggle.

Getting added to the S&P 500 is like a golden ticket to gains this year.  X  Fourteen companies joined the S&P 500 this year, including IBD Long-Term Leaders like Pool (POOL) and Domino s Pizza (DPZ), plus watchlist companies like West Pharmaceutical (WST) and Tyler Technologies (TYL).  S&P Membership A Golden Ticket  Shares of these S&P 500 newbies have soared 28.2% from their respective debuts in the world s most popular stock index. And that s roughly double the adjusted gain of the S&P during the same period, says an Investor s Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Dow Jones Indices and MarketSmith.  Getting added to the S&P 500 also rarely fails for investors. All but one of the stocks added to the index this year gained on the addition.  Tesla s (TSLA) absence from the S&P 500 is still a big gap. The electric-vehicle maker is worth nearly $400 billion, which would instantly place it in the top 10 most valuable companies in the S&P. It s also the new favorite stock of millennials.  But Tesla s absence opened up big opportunity, and gains, for other stocks and their investors.  No Tesla Stock Yet? Looking At S&P 500 Changes  The 14 additions to the S&P 500 are in line with a typical amount of annual turnover in the index. During all of 2019, 18 companies joined the index. And that was slightly less than the 24, 26 and 26 stocks added in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  And all the stocks added this year hail from just four of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. Information technology and health care tied with four additions each into the index. And then consumer discretionary and industrials followed with three apiece.  Given the rise of technology stocks, as many are perfectly positioned in the pandemic, it s easy to see why so many joined the S&P 500. Don t laugh at the industrials, though, which are coming on strong as the election draws near.  In fact, industrial Carrier Global (CARR) is the top-performing stock added to the S&P 500 in 2020 so far. The maker of heating, cooling and ventilation systems is up more than 163% from its inclusion in early April. The S&P is only up 39% since then.  Long-Term Leaders Join  Tesla is still waiting to join the S&P 500. But investors are making big gains on stocks getting in before it.  One of the stocks to join the S&P 500 in October is leading consumer discretionary stock Pool. The seller of swimming pool maintenance equipment joined on Oct. 6 and continues to deliver solid results. The stock is up 10.2% just since joining, while the index is up just 3.1%. Analysts think the company will make an adjusted $8.27 a share in 2020, up more than 29% from 2019 levels. The stock carries a perfect 99 IBD Composite Rating.  Domino s is another Long-Term Leader that s done well for investors. It graduated from the S&P MidCap 400 on May 11. It s only up 4.4% since then, trailing the 18% gain of the S&P 500 in that time. But this 90 IBD Composite Stock is up nearly 300% in the past five years, making the S&P 500 look like it s standing still with a 66% rise in that time.  Tesla will likely get its shot in the index. Its stock is up more than 380% this year. Just CEO Elon Musk s holdings in the company are worth more than Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), combined. And analysts think Tesla will make $2.35 a share this year, up 5,775% from 2019.  But don t worry. There are plenty of other ways to score on the S&P 500 newcomers as you wait for Tesla stock.

33,2020-10-26,07:28:00,TSLA,https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-telehealth-and-the-genomics-revolution-power-ark-funds-51603450802?siteid=yhoof2,"Why a Student of Disruptive Innovation Is Betting on Tesla, Telehealth, and Genomics","Text size  ARK Investment Management has been in the spotlight since it was founded in 2014. The firm is solely focused on disruptive innovation—and founder Cathie Wood, a trained economist, is famously bullish on Tesla and Bitcoin, two frequently contentious investments. ARK’s optimism about both has given the firm a stellar track record.  How stellar? The company’s five actively managed exchange-traded funds have returned 92% year to date on average, and the four that have five-year records have returned an annualized 37% in that time, beating the broad market and most actively managed competitors. Today, the firm manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion in ETFs.  Barron’s interviewed Wood in early August of last year, when unemployment was at historic lows and the stock market was on a tear. Now, as the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted many aspects of our lives and possibly ushered in permanent social and economic changes, Wood chatted with Barron’s again—about innovation and destruction in a post-Covid world, a new golden age for health care, her favorite stocks for the digital workspace, Tesla (ticker: TSLA), Nikola (NKLA), and more. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.  Barron’s: You’re a student of disruption. What does Covid mean for the global economy?  Cathie Wood: Covid-19 is accelerating all the disruptive innovations. Many companies that serve the digital workplace say they didn’t expect this many customers for at least three to five years. There’s been a rush into the new world. The other side of disruptive innovation is creative destruction. Many companies are being disintermediated by these new platforms—not surprisingly, in financials, energy, and industrials tied to the internal combustion engine. There are a lot of companies in harm’s way.  You describe innovation as a sub-asset class, similar to emerging markets in the 1980s. How is innovation as an investment style different from growth investing?  Innovation is early-stage growth, and it is typically exponential growth. Companies developing these platforms can generate revenue growth of more than 20% [annually] for years and years. Most growth companies have a decay rate, which means the bigger a company gets, the harder it is to grow. Exponential growth often includes network effects and virality, which means the more people joining the network, the more valuable it becomes, and the faster it grows.  ARK runs concentrated portfolios, typically with fewer than 50 stocks. How do you choose?  Our ideas start with our research, not any index. For example, we take a blank sheet of paper and just say, “What is an autonomous vehicle? What’s the right way to build one? What are the critical variables?” We inevitably run into the companies that not only have good answers, but are leading the charge.  It’s not like we don’t make mistakes. In the early days, we thought Lidar [a technology that measures distance for autonomous vehicles] was going to become a really important part of the autonomous taxi network. That wasn’t correct. But we probably are pushing the envelope further and faster than most people, and we have a much longer time horizon, at least seven years. That’s the biggest secret to our strategy—the willingness to step in when others are selling a stock for very short-term reasons. We get great opportunities like that.  What areas of the market are you most intrigued by these days?  The most inefficiently priced and underappreciated part of the market is genomics, and the most misunderstood is health care. Health care is the largest part of our portfolio—it’s about 37% of the flagship ARK Innovation [ARKK]. Technology is an important part of every sector, and is blurring the lines between and among sectors. Health care [will see] the convergence of DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence, and CRISPR gene editing—all new technologies that have fallen enough in cost and price and are ready for prime time now.  We learned from the coronavirus that there were weak links in the supply chain in terms of tests and vaccines. But what we have this year—very unusual—is cover for the health-care space. No one in Congress wants to vote against budgets to help get us all back to work.  We think we’re headed into another golden age for health care. Genentech launched the biotech revolution in the ’80s, and we had 20 years of rising returns on investments in health care. They became super stocks. That’s about to happen again.  Does ARK own any companies working on a Covid-19 vaccine?  We own various parts of the ecosystem leading up to the vaccine. Moderna [MRNA] gets all the headlines, but there’s room for many. In the ARK Genomic Revolution [ARKG] portfolio, we own a vaccine company called Arcturus Therapeutics [ARCT] that uses the self-replicating MRNA. That means when you get the vaccine, you don’t have to go for a booster shot like you do with Moderna’s vaccine. The other one is Inovio Pharmaceuticals [INO], a DNA vaccine manufacturer. In the flagship portfolio we have DNA sequencer Illumina [ILMN] and synthetic biology company Twist Bioscience [TWST]. Illumina was able to read the genomic profile of the Covid-19, and Twist was able to write the instructions and send them to the testing companies so they could develop tests.  What companies have you added to the portfolio this year?  When stocks were really beaten up, we bought some companies whose previous valuations were just too high for us. Telehealth is a very big idea; Teladoc Health [TDOC] just made a terrific acquisition. DocuSign [DOCU] is another Covid-inspired name. We knew security would rise as an important issue, more so now as people are working away from their offices, so we bought CrowdStrike [CRWD] and Zscaler [ZS]. Another company perfect for the digital workplace is PagerDuty [PD]. It offers over-the-air software updates before companies even know they have a problem with their networks. PagerDuty partners with Zoom, Amazon Web Services, and Salesforce.com. These enterprises are going to encourage others to buy the service as well. [CrowdStrike, Zscaler, DocuSign, and PagerDuty have all gone public in the past two years.]  You’re famous for being a Tesla bull. What do you like now?  We believe Tesla is going to launch a ride-hailing network to compete against Uber [UBER] and Lyft [LYFT]. If it does that successfully, it will be able to provide drivers with cars. The total cost of ownership and operating will be about one-third less than a Toyota Camry. It’s going to be a win-win situation—drivers can pay $5,000 down and work the rest of the car off by driving it, while Tesla gets the data that the driver delivers every day for its artificial intelligence engine. When the world goes autonomous—unlike drivers who were working for Uber and Lyft who will be left out of the party—Tesla’s ride-hailing network of drivers will own an autonomous car that will work for them. They will be entrepreneurs.  If Tesla pulls this off, it will be so much more profitable than just building cars. Electric-vehicle margins are in the 20s [percent range]; ride-hailing is probably in the 40s; and software-as-a-service and autonomous vehicles will be in the 80s. This is a margin structure that most auto analysts have never seen.  A lot of people have compared Nikola, which makes trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells, to Tesla, which uses electric batteries. Do you see the parallel?  No. More importantly, Nikola was comparing itself to Tesla, so we did take a close look. We started doing research on hydrogen fuel cells in 2015. We learned that it is 33% more expensive for a trucker to operate a hydrogen fuel-cell truck over a seven-year period. And the infrastructure for a hydrogen-fuel ecosystem costs five to 10 times more than electric infrastructures. The most important difference is: I charge my Tesla at home; you’ll not be able to do that with a hydrogen fuel-cell car. So frankly, it’s an uneconomic idea. Toyota has not had success with its hydrogen fuel-cell car. I don’t know why we should believe it will be successful for trucks.  You wrote to Elon Musk in 2018 to dissuade him from taking the company private. Is there a risk that great innovative companies could remain privately held for longer?  Companies that are staying private for so long are spending too much time getting ready for their liquidity event, prettying things up—and they’re losing strategic focus. Good cases in point are Uber and Lyft. By all rights, they should have the autonomous-taxi network opportunity; they should be in the pole position. But they’re nowhere [close to that]. In fact, their stocks have been cut almost in half since the IPO—even before the coronavirus. If they had started outfitting the cars of their drivers, they could have much more data today than Tesla. The name of the game in the autonomous world is, who is going to have the most real-world driving data and the highest quality data, along with the best AI expertise. They don’t, because they weren’t thinking about this, but they should have been.  What else do you like?  If we’re going to bring supply chains closer to home, 3D printing. Even though it’s had a very slow start and is exclusive to the aerospace area, adoption will accelerate because it’s so much cheaper and faster, and you can manufacture very close to the end consumer. Another area is industrial robots. Collaborative robots, in particular, are covered with sensors, so they can work alongside human beings. That’s especially relevant now that human beings are going to have to socially distance a bit more.  Thanks, Cathie.  Pouncing on Opportunities  ARK’s five  actively managed ETFs have an average  year-to-date return of  92%  with help from  big bets on Covid-inspired stocks  like Teladoc."

So far this earnings season, just two S&P stocks from the auto sector, namely PACCAR PCAR and Genuine Parts GPC, came up with quarterly numbers. Various other auto firms including the red-hot electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla TSLA, auto retailers namely Lithia Motors, Penske Automotive and AutoNation, as well as recreational vehicle maker Winnebago WGO unveiled quarterly numbers. Encouragingly, all the above-mentioned companies managed to deliver earnings beat. 
Meanwhile, U.S. auto giant General Motors GM grabbed limelight as it continues to step up its EV game. The firm announced plans to spend $2 billion to convert the Tennessee assembly plant to manufacture green vehicles. It also unveiled the first look of 2022 GMC Hummer EV sport utility truck. On the contrary, Harley-Davidson HOG recalled more than 1,000 LiveWire bikes in the United States.

1. Tesla reported stellar results for third-quarter 2020, posting profit for the fifth consecutive quarter. The company reported earnings of 76 cents, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents per share. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago earnings of 37 cents a share. Total revenues came in at $8,771 million, surpassing the consensus mark of $8,225 million. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 39%. Tesla has maintained the target of 500K deliveries for full-year 2020. Importantly, the firm generated free cash flow of $1,395 million during the quarter. The metric compared favorably with $418 million and $371 million recorded in the prior quarter and the year-ago period, respectively. (Tesla Q3 Earnings Beat,  20 Delivery Target Intact)
2. General Motors recently announced the decision to invest $2 billion in its Spring Hill, TN assembly plant. This will facilitate the transition of the assembly plant to become the company’s third vehicle production facility for manufacturing electric vehicles (EV).Its two existing EV manufacturing plants are Factory Zero in Detroit and Hamtramck, MI, and Orion Assembly in Orion Township, MI. The new luxury Cadillac LYRIQ will be the first EV to be manufactured at Spring Hill, along with the conventional combustion engine-powered Cadillac XT6 and XT5 luxury SUV crossovers, making the plant at Spring Hill not 100% electric, unlike the Factory Zero and Orion Assembly plants.

35,2020-10-26,07:00:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robotaxis-still-distant-dream-lidar-110000086.html,"With Robotaxis Still a Distant Dream, Lidar Makes Itself Useful","(Bloomberg) -- The promise of self-driving cars and robotaxi fleets once seemed just around the corner, but reality is setting in. Makers of the underlying technology are pivoting to more realistic ways of making money in the here and now.
Among the most expensive components of autonomous vehicles are laser-based sensors that allow a car’s computer to “see” its surroundings. As automakers push back timelines for introducing self-driving models, companies that specialize in these laser sensors, known as lidar, are targeting more limited features for passenger cars that will go into production in a few years. That’s a shift from the driverless fleets once at the center of manufacturers’ strategies.
Companies are betting they can make this business model work by whittling down the cost of laser sensors, which can reach thousands of dollars. That would make it affordable enough for automakers introducing semi-autonomous features such as hands-free highway driving. Lidar is becoming more familiar to consumers, too, and is a feature of higher-end versions of Apple Inc.’s new iPhone 12.
Lidar startups have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, seizing on demand for high-tech auto investments. Luminar Technologies Inc.’s 25-year-old founder is set to become one of the world’s youngest billionaires when it completes a reverse merger later this year, and Velodyne Lidar Inc. went public via reverse merger last month.
The game plan is to generate revenue on the long road to full autonomy, said Grayson Brulte, who runs a consulting firm in Palm Beach, Florida, focused on autonomous vehicles.“The only way in the current mobility market for autonomy or semi-autonomy to show revenue growth is ADAS,” said Brulte, using industry parlance for partial autonomy, or Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. “As higher levels of autonomy mature, then you can start to have that additional revenue growth.”
Surge in Sensors
The market for lidar sensors in light-duty vehicles could reach $46 billion in sales by 2030, with much of that going to enable partial autonomy, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst with Guidehouse Insights, a research company. A lot of that volume will come from makers of low-cost lidar sensors, including Continental AG and radar supplier Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH, he said.
Innoviz Technologies Ltd., an Israeli startup backed by two of the world’s largest auto suppliers, Aptiv Plc and Magna International Inc., is pitching its latest sensors as a cheaper way for automakers to start phasing in more-sophisticated technology because it allows for upgrades as self-driving systems become more capable and widespread.
Innoviz supplies lidar for BMW AG’s iNext car due in 2021, which will gradually introduce so-called Level 3 autonomy, meaning drivers will be able to take their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road in limited circumstances.
“This is really solving a big problem,” said Omer Keilaf, the company’s chief executive officer.
Most self-driving developers consider lidar a critical safety layer that will enable cars to assume responsibility on highways, freeing up drivers to check email or watch a movie. It’s a big leap from Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot or General Motors Co.’s Super Cruise driver-assistance systems, which require motorists to keep their eyes and minds on the road even if their hands are off the wheel.
Gathering Data
Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk famously dismisses lidar, has been gathering self-driving data for years by installing its camera-and-radar-based driver-assistance system on its cars. Last week, Tesla began rolling out a beta version of what it calls “Full Self-Driving” to some of its biggest fans and influencers to try out. Musk plans to charge $10,000 a pop for the package, which Tesla claims is advanced enough to use when driving on busy city streets -- not just on highways.
Tesla didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.
Despite its name -- and Musk’s promises -- the system does not offer full self-driving. Federal regulators are probing deadly crashes involving Autopilot, and critics have slammed the company for rolling it out prematurely.
Keilaf says Innoviz’s approach would be safer than Tesla’s, because lidar -- which works well in low-light conditions -- would serve as a backup for cameras and radar.
His company’s latest iteration will cost $500 per unit when produced at high volumes, Keilaf said. That is closer to the $40 to $50 per-unit cost for radar sensors and $10 to $15 for cameras, several of which are typically installed on each vehicle, Abuelsamid said.
Holy Grail Delayed
Luminar, which agreed to go public in a $3.4 billion reverse merger earlier this year, is supplying lidar for Volvo Car AB’s self-driving system that will be installed on cars starting in 2022. Dubbed Highway Pilot, it won’t require drivers to keep their eyes on the road at all times.“It will likely take hundreds of thousands of vehicles to enable autonomy,” Luminar CEO Austin Russell wrote in a letter to investors earlier this month. “That scale is exactly what we can deliver with series production on consumer vehicles.”
Adding lidar will be lucrative for automakers because they can charge thousands of dollars more for the option of advanced autonomous features, Russell said in an interview.
The industry’s focus on mass-production of passenger cars is a shift from a few years ago, when companies including Innoviz and Velodyne had trained their sights on AV test fleets. Since then, GM has delayed the rollout of its robotaxi service, while Ford Motor Co.’s former CEO said last year that the industry had overestimated the arrival of self-driving cars.
“If you talk to anybody about three to four years ago, everyone was working on this holy grail of autonomy,” Velodyne CEO Anand Gopalan said in an interview.
Pandemic Threat
Now driver-assist systems represent about 35% of the projects Velodyne has won or hopes to win in the next five years, while AVs and industrial robots make up about a 20% slice each.
