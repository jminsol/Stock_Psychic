With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

Big Tech has been this year's most prominent market drivers, and its grandiose 2020 returns are being put to the test once again.

This week of major earnings reports leads up to one of the most controversial elections in US history, while a global pandemic picks back up and economic risk swells. This rising anxiety has some investors on the run, pulling profits where they can. Let's take a look at this week's action and what to expect from this week's big hitters.

Last Week's Recap

Last week we had some mixed results from our tech powerhouses. Last week, Netflix NFLX released highly anticipated earnings on Tuesday, disappointing investors after illustrating weaker than expected subscription growth. NFLX shares have tumbled 8% since, as investors and traders pull profits. Still, the shares remain up 49% for the year.

Tesla TSLA just released its Q3 earnings with record figures on effectively every metric. The innovation-driven automaker just recorded its 5th consecutive profitable quarter.

Elon Musk and his automotive giant are finally keeping their ostentatious promises. Elon promised half a million cars delivered by the end of 2020, and the company might just be able to pull it off.

In the face of a global pandemic and economic recession, Tesla was able to deliver a record number of EVs. The enterprise is looking at a very bright future, and it seems that every quarter TSLA's seemingly lofty valuation is further justified.

Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory was a success, and its Berlin Gigafactory is set to start production next summer. Tesla is undoubtedly going to be a major automotive driver in the Roaring 20s.

What to Expect This Week

5 out of the top 6 largest companies in the world are reporting this week, and this could catalyze some sizable market-moving action.

Tech has faltered since the beginning of September as the pre-election jitters begin to impress fear into investment/trading decisions. The 3 largest world tech giants: Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, and Amazon AMZN, have all dipped below their 50-day and will be looking towards their 200-day moving averages for support if this week's results add to the selling pressure.

Story continues

Below are the critical tech earnings to look forward to this week, along with Zacks Consensus estimates.

Levels to Watch

The markets are really taking a tumble today as COVID-19 cases surge over the weekend to record levels. Investors and traders are worried that this second pandemic wave will send another financially devastating shockwave through the economy.

MSFT is down over 3% today, once again dipping below its 50-day moving average (blue line), which sits at $212.50. The next big support level, if the shares continue down through its September quarter earnings, is around $190, which represents the 200-day moving average (red line) as well as the stock's pre-pandemic highs.

AAPL is down marginally today and is in a similar position to MSFT, having dropped below its 50-moving average (blue line) and is moving lower. The support level to watch out for here is $100 per share, which I have circled in red. If it breaks below this level, watch out for its 200-day moving average of around $90 per share to support the stock.

AMZN has been trading sideways since the beginning of July, stuck in a trading rut between $2,900 and $3,500 per share. The stock has fallen below its 50-day moving average (blue) and is looking towards Thursday's results to push the shares back into growth. AMZN is trading at $3,190 and will be looking at the $3,100 level for support (circled). Analysts are anticipating record figures from the e-com and cloud giant. Let's see if this tech behemoth can deliver.

Final Thoughts

If these three tech pioneers make it down to their 200-day moving averages, I will not hesitate to buy. There is an enormous amount of uncertainty in the markets with a record daily COVID cases and maybe one of the US's most contentious elections a week away. I would be cautious in purchasing any stocks going into earnings this week.

As Tom recalls, ""He looked at me and he said, 'I don't know, I just learned. Don't bet against my brother.'""

Tesla short-sellers are learning that the hard way (again) after Tesla shattered analysts' expectations for the company's third quarter results, which were released on Oct. 21 after market close. Here's what investors need to know.

By the numbers

Metric Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q3 2019 YOY % Change Revenue $8.8 billion $6.0 billion $6.3 billion 39% Net Income $331 million $104 million $143 million 131% Adjusted EPS* $0.76 $0.44 $0.37 105% Operating Cash Flow $2.4 billion $964 million $756 million 217% Free Cash Flow $1.4 billion $418 million $371 million 276%

Those are impressive numbers, made even more impressive by the fact that they're being posted in the midst of a U.S. recession during which there are fewer drivers on the roads. When 39% revenue growth is the lowest percentage gain in your marquee figures, you know it's at least a good report. For Tesla, the third quarter wasn't just good: it was record-setting.

Quarterly revenue set a new record high for the company, at $8.8 billion, which was expected due to the company's strong delivery numbers. Another record is the $331 million in quarterly net income, which surpassed Tesla's previous milestone of $311 million, set in third quarter 2018. For me, the most jaw-dropping figure is Tesla's $2.4 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter, which is nearly double its previous quarterly record, set in fourth quarter 2017.

Despite the company's outperformance -- EPS topped analysts' consensus estimates by $0.20/share -- shares closed up less than 1% from the previous day's close. This could indicate that the expectation of big growth is already priced into the lofty valuation of Tesla's stock.

What Musk had to say

CEO Elon Musk, never one to understate his successes, started the earnings call by telling it the way he saw it: ""All right. So, Q3 was our best quarter in history.""

He highlighted the company's other initiatives, including the incremental advances in battery technology that Tesla showcased at its Battery Day, the beta release of Full Self-Driving mode, the continued buildout of the company's manufacturing capabilities, and a projected increase in sales of Solar Roof, which he referred to as a ""killer product.""

He also doubled down on the company's stated goal of continuing to cut prices:

If the car is too expensive... and people don't have enough money in their bank account, they simply can't buy it no matter what the value proposition is. So it is important to lower the prices. ... I do not think we lack for desire for our product, but we do lack for affordability.

The catch-22

Some analysts are concerned that, as the company grows sales of its lower-priced cars and pursues price cuts, it won't be able to maintain its double-digit margin target. CFO Zachary Kirkhorn agreed with Musk on the need for affordability, but didn't think it was mutually exclusive with margin growth:

If you just look at the journey of the company over the last 1.5 years, we have grown volumes and grown gross margins despite a number of price reductions over that period of time, and we have kept OpEx fairly stable during that period of time as well. We have to also continue to make progress improving the cost structure ... and improve the value of the vehicles at the same time. So in addition to reducing the cost of the car, we're making the cars better. And that's the formula to sell the volume. That's what we're focused on.

One way to do this, according to Musk, is to bring as much manufacturing in-house as possible. ""There's in excess of a dozen start-ups effectively in Tesla,"" Musk said, citing microchips, battery cells, superchargers, and autonomous driving as areas that other car companies outsource but Tesla doesn't. ""Tesla is absolutely vertically integrated compared to other auto companies or basically most any company,"" said Musk. ""We literally make the machine.""

""Quite frankly, we would like to outsource less,"" concluded Musk. ""That would be great.""

What Q3 tells investors

The third quarter's strong performance indicates that Tesla has finally turned the corner when it comes to profitability and cash flow generation from its passenger cars.

Interestingly, Musk and his management team didn't even mention the Semi or Cybertruck until they were specifically asked about them by the analysts on the call. They only briefly mentioned the company's often-overlooked energy storage products, Powerwall and Megacell. The primary focus of the earnings call -- and the company -- is clearly on its passenger cars.

That's probably good news for investors, since Tesla's cars are in demand and selling well. Focusing on maximizing their profitability and improving their affordability is probably going to give Tesla the biggest bang for its buck in terms of improving the (already-much-improved) bottom line.

Tesla's sky-high valuation should give new investors pause, but operationally, it seems to be on solid footing, and its impressive growth streak seems likely to continue. I wouldn't place any bets against the company right now."

With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

8,2020-10-26,09:21:00,TSLA,https://www.investopedia.com/etsys-etsy-resilience-through-the-pandemic-and-beyond-5084061?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral,Etsy's (ETSY) Resilience Through the Pandemic and Beyond,"Etsy, Inc. (ETSY), an e-commerce platform beloved by craft enthusiasts everywhere, became one of the recent pandemic-era additions to the S&P 500 index.

Key Takeaways Etsy is due to report earnings on Oct. 28

Etsy's performance during the pandemic has been a result of its strategic positioning over the past 15 years as well as stumbles by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN).

In September, S&P Dow Jones Indices added Etsy to the S&P 500, removing H&R Block, Inc. (HRB), Coty Inc. (COTY), and Kohl's Corporation (KSS). Notably, the addition of Etsy, a Brooklyn-born crafts marketplace, came ahead of the anticipated addition of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) due to potential questions about Tesla's profitability. Morningstar's David Whiston told Fortune that ""stability of Tesla's earnings"" may be behind S&P's decision.

The share price of Etsy, which is reporting third quarter earnings on Oct. 28, is up significantly from below $50 at the start of the year before the outbreak of COVID-19. While 2020 has been brutal to a lot of retailers, Etsy has been weathering the pandemic remarkably well as more consumers are shopping online, spending time at home, and picking up new hobbies.

""We view the pandemic as benefiting Etsy through an uptick in digital demand while also creating a window of opportunity to capture new customers looking to buy (COVID-19) masks,"" said Needham analyst Rick Patel. ""We believe Etsy is making good progress in retaining these customers, which should fuel future growth.""

While many retailers big and small have crashed since the rise of Amazon and eBay Inc. (EBAY), Etsy has stayed the course. In fact, 2020 may prove to be its biggest year yet. Etsy's performance in this pandemic is a result of its strategic positioning over the past 15 years – as well as Amazon's stumbles. In many ways, the core of Etsy's success is its mission to offer ""handcrafted and differentiated"" goods as well as allowing its visitors to browse and search for these unique products.

Come for the Masks, Stay for the Rest

In the second quarter, Etsy reported $356 million in mask sales, which the company described at the earnings call as ""enough masks to stretch all the way from New York to London."" The huge demand for face coverings also fueled non-mask sales, which jumped 93% in the same quarter, according to company data.

""Most of the customers who go to Etsy for the first time in order to buy masks end up buying other products too, and many of them will remain on the platform going forward,"" according to Needham analysts.

Masks aside, Etsy's top category of homewares and home furnishings was up 128% compared to a year before. The sales of craft supplies jumped 138%, and jewelry and accessory sales were also up 50%. The ability to browse, search, and more recently to save searches for relevant products is one part of Etsy's appeal to its buyers and sellers. The company's gross profit margin is expanding – it was 74% in the second quarter, an increase of 640 basis points compared to 67.6% a year before.

Bigger Market

Etsy has performed so well in the past few months that the company is rethinking its addressable market. In 2019, Etsy estimated its target market at $100 billion, based on assumptions of the top six countries, separation of online and offline shopping experiences, and product differentiation.

""In fact, COVID has helped to explode each of those three assumptions. Etsy competes in almost every market in the world, not just the core six. And in fact the distinction between online and offline has all (but) evaporated in the past few months,"" Josh Silverman, Etsy's CEO, said on the earnings call. ""When we pull back and look at what we've learned over the past three months, it reinforces my belief that the size of Etsy's addressable market starts with a T not with a B. All of this gives us even more conviction about the size of the pricing that Etsy is changing and the opportunity to invest to fully realize that growth.""

Amazon Competition

Amazon will still likely dominate e-commerce ad spending, according to Insider Intelligence research. The firm projects Etsy's share of e-commerce ad spending to grow by nearly 70% to $133.2 million.

Amazon did launch Handmade in 2015, but so far it hasn't deterred Etsy's growth. With continued improvements to Etsy's machine learning and experimentation with augmented reality features, Etsy is poised to remain competitive across handmade categories.

Many small crafts sellers on Amazon continue to compete against its ""vast database of mass-produced merchandise,"" according to reporting by OneZero earlier this year. ""One Amazon Handmade seller said that, at times, she cannot find her own store using Amazon's search feature,"" the firm reported. Amazon is trying to change that, planning to improve search and discovery features, as reported by Business Insider.

Until then, Etsy is likely to continue to benefit from increased online engagement, growing ad spending on all e-commerce platforms, and deeper differentiation of its platform as a go-to marketplace for unique, handmade goods."

Chinese government-backed news outlet The Paper reports on Monday that Tesla will ship about 7,000 Model 3s from its Shanghai factory to a port in Belgium for delivery to customers in countries throughout Europe.

The ship carrying the Teslas will depart on Tuesday and is expected to arrive in late November, according to the report.

It's the first time that Tesla has exported vehicles from its factory in China. Shanghai's deputy mayor, Chen Yin, who spoke at a ceremony to mark the occasion on Monday, said that Tesla's Shanghai factory, which opened late last year, is now producing between 3,500 and 4,000 Model 3 sedans per week.

The company is in the process of building a second assembly line at the factory for the Model Y crossover SUV, Chen said.

Tesla's China chief, Zhu Xiotong, said that the Model 3s heading to Europe have the same battery life as its standard-specification Chinese-market models. The sedans have passed all of the European-market certification requirements, he said.

Tesla's factory in Shanghai is the first auto factory in China to be built by a global automaker outside of a joint venture with a domestic Chinese automaker. The factory, located in a special ""free trade zone"" in Shanghai, has become a point of pride for local politicians because of the speed of its construction: It took less than a year for the factory to go from groundbreaking to the start of production."

Tesla (TSLA) - Get Report on Tuesday reportedly will ship about 7,000 made-in-China electric cars to Europe.

Shares of the Palo Alto, Calif., automaker at last check were down 1.8% to $413.04.

The Model 3s were made at the company's Shanghai gigafactory, CNBC reported, citing a report in the China-backed outlet the Paper.

They are scheduled to arrive in Belgium at the end of next month, with planned deliveries to Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, Sweden and other countries.

The company said that Model 3 production capacity for the Shanghai factory, which opened a year ago, has reached 250,000 units a year.

Chinese regulators said last week that Tesla was recalling as many as 48,442 of its U.S.-made Model S and Model X cars that it sold to customers in China. That's due to potentially faulty and unsafe front and rear suspensions.

Separately, Tesla said in a regulatory filing that a fourth tranche of Tesla stock options will vest to Chief Executive Elon Musk upon certification that milestones laid out in his 2018 performance award have been achieved.

This month, the market capitalization milestone of $250 billion was achieved, and the operational milestone of annualized adjusted Ebitda of $4.5 billion will be achieved as of the issuance of Tesla’s Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-Q quarterly report.

Tesla said it expected that the remaining unamortized expense of $122 million associated with the fourth market-capitalization-milestone period will be accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2020. Tesla had expected to recognize that expense in quarters through third-quarter 2023.

The company in the filing said that as of and following September ""there has continued to be widespread impact to the global economy"" from the coronavirus pandemic.

""We temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of 2020,"" the filing said.

Exiting first-half 2020, however, ""we have resumed operations at all of our manufacturing facilities, continue to increase our output and add additional capacity, and are working with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production,"" Tesla said.

Last week, Tesla reported third quarter results that topped analyst estimates."

It's a pivotal week for the stock market rally. Hopes for a pre-election stimulus deal are fading. It's the heart of earnings season, with Apple stock, and Microsoft (MSFT) among those reporting.

The market rally suffered further losses last week, but the major indexes and leading stocks found support and pared losses.

Wall Street is heading into the peak week of earnings. Along with Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft stock, Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), AMD (AMD), Shopify (SHOP), Twilio (TWLO), ServiceNow (NOW) among the hundreds of companies reporting. It's the last full week before the presidential election. New coronavirus cases are breaking records in the U.S. and Europe, but Covid vaccine news could come any day. And stimulus deal hopes and doubts remain.

All of this is taking place with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq at key levels. The major indexes and many leaders, such as Microsoft stock, Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Tesla (TSLA), could offer buying opportunities with a good day or two. But one or two bad sessions could trigger serious concerns about the stock market rally.

Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks

Leaderboard Stocks

Tesla, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce stock are all on IBD Leaderboard.

Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe stock also are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Unlike Apple and Amazon stock, which are not Long-Term Leaders, these three software giants are all holding above their 10-week moving averages. The 10-week line is a good place to buy Long-Term Leaders, but investors should wait to see a little more strength in these stocks, as well as the market rally. Microsoft earnings also loom.

Meanwhile, Tesla stock also has found support near its 10-week line, with buy points or sell signals not far away. It's hard to believe it, but the Tesla news cycle might quiet down for a time.

The Latest IBD/TIPP Trump Vs. Biden Tracking Poll

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures fell 1.15% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.95%.

Along with the surge in coronavirus cases, stalled stimulus deal talks also could influence Dow Jones futures. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday blamed President Trump for the lack of a stimulus deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been stimulus deal talks with Pelosi, said the White House has offered compromises but the Speaker is ""dug in.""

The House is already out while the Senate will leave town on Monday, after the likely confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. While Congress could be called back to vote on a stimulus deal, that seems unlikely with election campaigns in the final stretch.

Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 GOP senator, said Sunday that he hopes a stimulus deal can be passed after the election.

Meanwhile, German software giant SAP (SAP) on Sunday cut its full-year revenue and operating profit forecasts, saying the coronavirus pandemic will hurt demand ""at least"" through mid-2021. SAP did beat Q3 profit views, though revenue missed.

SAP stock plunged roughly 20% in premarket trading.

Coronavirus Cases

Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 43.43 million, according to Worldometers. Daily coronavirus cases worldwide are approaching half a million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.16 million.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 8.88 million, with deaths above 230,000.

Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short and political adviser Marty Obst have tested positive for the coronavirus. NBC News reported at two more Pence aides have tested positive for the coronavirus, while ABC News said a total of five people in the vice president's ""orbit"" have tested positive.

Pence, who has tested negative again, has decided not to quarantine and will continue campaigning.

The U.S. added 81,210 new coronavirus cases on Friday, a new daily record, followed by 79,449 on Saturday. That's partly due to increased testing from earlier in the year, but positive test results are rising sharply as well. Coronavirus restrictions have eased from earlier in the year, but the biggest factor may be Americans weary of following social distancing and mask rules.

Several European countries have been hitting daily records, with Spain and France now with more than one million Covid-19 cases in total. Much of Europe has reimposed tougher coronavirus restrictions, but not much in U.S. cities and states so far.

If coronavirus restrictions are reimposed, that could stall a relatively solid economic recovery. That would likely add pressure for a new stimulus deal.

Coronavirus death rates remain relatively low, reflecting better treatments and procedures and the lag between infection and fatalities. Hospitalizations for the coronavirus have risen sharply, however.

Coronavirus Vaccine News Soon?

Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) and partner BioNTech (BNTX) could release interim effectiveness data on their coronavirus vaccine candidate from final-stage trials any day, with a possible FDA approval request by late November. Moderna (MRNA) could follow a few weeks later.

In a best-case scenario, millions of coronavirus vaccine doses will be out before year-end, targeting those most at risk. But it would still take many months to vaccinate most Americans.

Both Pfizer and Moderna report earnings this coming week.

The AstraZeneca (AZN) Covid-19 vaccine reportedly produces a robust antibody and T-cell immune response in elderly people. The U.S. part of AstraZeneca's final-stage trial finally resumed Friday following a severe reaction by one participant.

A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine also has resumed late-stage trials after a brief pause over a participant's illness. The J&J Covid-19 vaccine candidate is one of the few that would require just a single dose.

U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 28336.62 -27.04 -0.10 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3465.59 +12.10 +0.35 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 11548.28 +42.28 +0.37 Russell 2000 (IWM) 162.98 +0.85 +0.52 IBD 50 (FFTY) 38.33 +0.30 +0.79 Last Update: 4:04 PM ET 10/23/2020

The stock market rally continued to slide, though the major indexes all found support at their 21-day exponential moving averages.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite slid 1.1%, but held its ground after tumbling 1.65% on Monday.

Apple stock fell 3.3%, closing near weekly lows. Amazon sank 2.1%. Microsoft sank 1.6%, but has now risen for the past four sessions. Salesforce retreated 3.1%. Adobe fell back 2.85%, but rallied Friday to get just above its 10-week line. Tesla stock sank 4.3%.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 2.7%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) lost 1.3%, with Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe all major components. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 1.4%.

Long-Term Leaders Near Buy Points

A good time to buy Long-Term Leaders is near their 10-week moving averages. Dow Jones stocks Microsoft and Salesforce rebounded from their 10-week lines this week, while Adobe reclaims that key level Friday.

But you want to see these stocks decisively break short trend lines in their handles, with similar action in the major indexes. But if these stocks are moving decisively higher, the Nasdaq likely will show positive action as well.

In the case of Dow Jones giant Microsoft, investors should wait until after its Tuesday night earnings.

Microsoft and Adobe fell about 1% early Monday. Salesforce stock lost nearly 2%.

Tesla Stock

After trying to break past an early entry on Oct. 14, Tesla stock has retreated, undercutting its 50-day and 10-week line on Friday but closing above those line.

Especially n a weekly chart, TSLA stock looks fine. It's been consolidating relatively tightly over the past several weeks and is once again finding support at the 10-week line. It's also forged a handle with a 466 buy point. Aggressive investors could use 445.33, just above Thursday's intraday high, as an early entry.

On the other hand, if Tesla decisively breaks below its 10-week line, investors may want to consider paring gains.

Over the last couple of months, there were several expected catalysts for Tesla stock: S&P 500 inclusion, Battery Day, Q3 deliveries and Q3 earnings. S&P inclusion hasn't happened while the other there events didn't drive TSLA stock higher. Then again, they haven't sunk the stock either.

Tesla stock fell 2% early Monday.

Tesla News About To Get Boring?

No, that's not a reference to Tesla sister company Boring.

In the next few weeks, the Tesla news cycle may actually quiet down. Sure, there is plenty going on. Tesla is exporting Model 3 cars from its Shanghai plant to Europe, taking over somewhat for the Fremont, Calif., plant.

In a new SEC filing Monday, Tesla said it expects capital spending in 2020 to be at the high end of its target range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. Capex already picked up in Q3. It sees capex of $4.5 billion to $6 billion in 2021 and 2022.

Tesla could cut the Model 3 prices in the U.S. in the coming weeks, after recently slashing Model 3 prices in China and cutting Model S prices.

No doubt, Elon Musk and Tesla will keep themselves in the public eye. The Full Self Driving beta launch is getting a lot of attention, with Tesla raising the FSD price to $10,000 on Monday even as critics note the Level 2 system's shortcomings.

But on paper, Tesla has few key ""circle that date"" events over the last couple of months. The Model Y will soon launch in China, though perhaps not until the start of 2021. Meanwhile, the Ford Mustang Mach E, a Model Y competitor, will launch in the U.S. before year-even. The VW ID.4, another Model Y rival, will start global deliveries around the start of the year.

So all of those events, along with Tesla's Q4 deliveries, herald a new round of headlines and the beginning of a critical year for the electric car industry.

These 4 Stocks Are Trading Bullishly, Offering New Buy Points

Stock Market Analysis

Heading into last week, there were reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Sure, the major indexes had pulled back, a little, but that was allowing many tech giants to form handles.

Then on Monday, Oct. 19, the major indexes suffered sharp losses, with growth names harder hit. After a couple of modest days, stocks undercut their 21-day lines in Thursday's session, with the 50-day line not far past that. Thankfully, the major indexes rebounded for slim gains, followed by Friday's rally into the close.

Arguably, the stock market rally is a good day or two from looking bullish again. Breaking the short trend lines in the Nasdaq would be a positive sign. Then again, it would only take a day or two for the market rally to look bearish, testing or undercutting 50-day lines.

Dow Jones futures suggest that the major indexes will test or undercut their 21-day lines at Monday's open, with the Dow itself sinking to around its 50-day line.

Game Plan The Market Rally

Analyze your stocks. A lot of mixed action in growth names this week. You might have cut back your exposure but still grade your current holdings. Several of your stocks may have earnings due in the next few days. Do you have enough of a cushion heading into results?

Build up your watch lists. There are a lot of good-looking charts. Many just need one push, whether from individual earnings or broad market strength, to flash clear buying signals. So you want to be ready.

Let The Stock Market Trend Be Your Friend

But while the stock market rally hasn't done anything seriously wrong over the past two weeks, it hasn't been a good environment for making money.

Earnings season is usually enough chaos for your portfolio. But this headline-driven stock market rally has so headlines to deal with right now: the presidential election, coronavirus vaccine news, stimulus deal talks. Coronavirus cases are front-and-center once again. All could swing the market one way or the other in the next few weeks.

Don't get too exposed. Wait for the market to show clear positive direction. That could happen in the next few days or weeks. There will be many breakouts and other buying opportunities if the market takes off again. If market heads lower, new buys are likely to struggle.

Getting added to the S&P 500 is like a golden ticket to gains this year.

X

Fourteen companies joined the S&P 500 this year, including IBD Long-Term Leaders like Pool (POOL) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ), plus watchlist companies like West Pharmaceutical (WST) and Tyler Technologies (TYL).

S&P Membership A Golden Ticket

Shares of these S&P 500 newbies have soared 28.2% from their respective debuts in the world's most popular stock index. And that's roughly double the adjusted gain of the S&P during the same period, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Dow Jones Indices and MarketSmith.

Getting added to the S&P 500 also rarely fails for investors. All but one of the stocks added to the index this year gained on the addition.

Tesla's (TSLA) absence from the S&P 500 is still a big gap. The electric-vehicle maker is worth nearly $400 billion, which would instantly place it in the top 10 most valuable companies in the S&P. It's also the new favorite stock of millennials.

But Tesla's absence opened up big opportunity, and gains, for other stocks and their investors.

No Tesla Stock Yet? Looking At S&P 500 Changes

The 14 additions to the S&P 500 are in line with a typical amount of annual turnover in the index. During all of 2019, 18 companies joined the index. And that was slightly less than the 24, 26 and 26 stocks added in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

And all the stocks added this year hail from just four of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. Information technology and health care tied with four additions each into the index. And then consumer discretionary and industrials followed with three apiece.

Given the rise of technology stocks, as many are perfectly positioned in the pandemic, it's easy to see why so many joined the S&P 500. Don't laugh at the industrials, though, which are coming on strong as the election draws near.

In fact, industrial Carrier Global (CARR) is the top-performing stock added to the S&P 500 in 2020 so far. The maker of heating, cooling and ventilation systems is up more than 163% from its inclusion in early April. The S&P is only up 39% since then.

Long-Term Leaders Join

Tesla is still waiting to join the S&P 500. But investors are making big gains on stocks getting in before it.

One of the stocks to join the S&P 500 in October is leading consumer discretionary stock Pool. The seller of swimming pool maintenance equipment joined on Oct. 6 and continues to deliver solid results. The stock is up 10.2% just since joining, while the index is up just 3.1%. Analysts think the company will make an adjusted $8.27 a share in 2020, up more than 29% from 2019 levels. The stock carries a perfect 99 IBD Composite Rating.

Domino's is another Long-Term Leader that's done well for investors. It graduated from the S&P MidCap 400 on May 11. It's only up 4.4% since then, trailing the 18% gain of the S&P 500 in that time. But this 90 IBD Composite Stock is up nearly 300% in the past five years, making the S&P 500 look like it's standing still with a 66% rise in that time.

Tesla will likely get its shot in the index. Its stock is up more than 380% this year. Just CEO Elon Musk's holdings in the company are worth more than Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), combined. And analysts think Tesla will make $2.35 a share this year, up 5,775% from 2019.

But don't worry. There are plenty of other ways to score on the S&P 500 newcomers as you wait for Tesla stock.

ARK Investment Management has been in the spotlight since it was founded in 2014. The firm is solely focused on disruptive innovation—and founder Cathie Wood, a trained economist, is famously bullish on Tesla and Bitcoin, two frequently contentious investments. ARK’s optimism about both has given the firm a stellar track record.

How stellar? The company’s five actively managed exchange-traded funds have returned 92% year to date on average, and the four that have five-year records have returned an annualized 37% in that time, beating the broad market and most actively managed competitors. Today, the firm manages $30 billion in assets, including $15 billion in ETFs.

Barron’s interviewed Wood in early August of last year, when unemployment was at historic lows and the stock market was on a tear. Now, as the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted many aspects of our lives and possibly ushered in permanent social and economic changes, Wood chatted with Barron’s again—about innovation and destruction in a post-Covid world, a new golden age for health care, her favorite stocks for the digital workspace, Tesla (ticker: TSLA), Nikola (NKLA), and more. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Barron’s: You’re a student of disruption. What does Covid mean for the global economy?

Cathie Wood: Covid-19 is accelerating all the disruptive innovations. Many companies that serve the digital workplace say they didn’t expect this many customers for at least three to five years. There’s been a rush into the new world. The other side of disruptive innovation is creative destruction. Many companies are being disintermediated by these new platforms—not surprisingly, in financials, energy, and industrials tied to the internal combustion engine. There are a lot of companies in harm’s way.

You describe innovation as a sub-asset class, similar to emerging markets in the 1980s. How is innovation as an investment style different from growth investing?

Innovation is early-stage growth, and it is typically exponential growth. Companies developing these platforms can generate revenue growth of more than 20% [annually] for years and years. Most growth companies have a decay rate, which means the bigger a company gets, the harder it is to grow. Exponential growth often includes network effects and virality, which means the more people joining the network, the more valuable it becomes, and the faster it grows.

ARK runs concentrated portfolios, typically with fewer than 50 stocks. How do you choose?

Our ideas start with our research, not any index. For example, we take a blank sheet of paper and just say, “What is an autonomous vehicle? What’s the right way to build one? What are the critical variables?” We inevitably run into the companies that not only have good answers, but are leading the charge.

It’s not like we don’t make mistakes. In the early days, we thought Lidar [a technology that measures distance for autonomous vehicles] was going to become a really important part of the autonomous taxi network. That wasn’t correct. But we probably are pushing the envelope further and faster than most people, and we have a much longer time horizon, at least seven years. That’s the biggest secret to our strategy—the willingness to step in when others are selling a stock for very short-term reasons. We get great opportunities like that.

What areas of the market are you most intrigued by these days?

The most inefficiently priced and underappreciated part of the market is genomics, and the most misunderstood is health care. Health care is the largest part of our portfolio—it’s about 37% of the flagship ARK Innovation [ARKK]. Technology is an important part of every sector, and is blurring the lines between and among sectors. Health care [will see] the convergence of DNA sequencing, artificial intelligence, and CRISPR gene editing—all new technologies that have fallen enough in cost and price and are ready for prime time now.

We learned from the coronavirus that there were weak links in the supply chain in terms of tests and vaccines. But what we have this year—very unusual—is cover for the health-care space. No one in Congress wants to vote against budgets to help get us all back to work.

We think we’re headed into another golden age for health care. Genentech launched the biotech revolution in the ’80s, and we had 20 years of rising returns on investments in health care. They became super stocks. That’s about to happen again.

Does ARK own any companies working on a Covid-19 vaccine?

We own various parts of the ecosystem leading up to the vaccine. Moderna [MRNA] gets all the headlines, but there’s room for many. In the ARK Genomic Revolution [ARKG] portfolio, we own a vaccine company called Arcturus Therapeutics [ARCT] that uses the self-replicating MRNA. That means when you get the vaccine, you don’t have to go for a booster shot like you do with Moderna’s vaccine. The other one is Inovio Pharmaceuticals [INO], a DNA vaccine manufacturer. In the flagship portfolio we have DNA sequencer Illumina [ILMN] and synthetic biology company Twist Bioscience [TWST]. Illumina was able to read the genomic profile of the Covid-19, and Twist was able to write the instructions and send them to the testing companies so they could develop tests.

What companies have you added to the portfolio this year?

When stocks were really beaten up, we bought some companies whose previous valuations were just too high for us. Telehealth is a very big idea; Teladoc Health [TDOC] just made a terrific acquisition. DocuSign [DOCU] is another Covid-inspired name. We knew security would rise as an important issue, more so now as people are working away from their offices, so we bought CrowdStrike [CRWD] and Zscaler [ZS]. Another company perfect for the digital workplace is PagerDuty [PD]. It offers over-the-air software updates before companies even know they have a problem with their networks. PagerDuty partners with Zoom, Amazon Web Services, and Salesforce.com. These enterprises are going to encourage others to buy the service as well. [CrowdStrike, Zscaler, DocuSign, and PagerDuty have all gone public in the past two years.]

You’re famous for being a Tesla bull. What do you like now?

We believe Tesla is going to launch a ride-hailing network to compete against Uber [UBER] and Lyft [LYFT]. If it does that successfully, it will be able to provide drivers with cars. The total cost of ownership and operating will be about one-third less than a Toyota Camry. It’s going to be a win-win situation—drivers can pay $5,000 down and work the rest of the car off by driving it, while Tesla gets the data that the driver delivers every day for its artificial intelligence engine. When the world goes autonomous—unlike drivers who were working for Uber and Lyft who will be left out of the party—Tesla’s ride-hailing network of drivers will own an autonomous car that will work for them. They will be entrepreneurs.

If Tesla pulls this off, it will be so much more profitable than just building cars. Electric-vehicle margins are in the 20s [percent range]; ride-hailing is probably in the 40s; and software-as-a-service and autonomous vehicles will be in the 80s. This is a margin structure that most auto analysts have never seen.

A lot of people have compared Nikola, which makes trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells, to Tesla, which uses electric batteries. Do you see the parallel?

No. More importantly, Nikola was comparing itself to Tesla, so we did take a close look. We started doing research on hydrogen fuel cells in 2015. We learned that it is 33% more expensive for a trucker to operate a hydrogen fuel-cell truck over a seven-year period. And the infrastructure for a hydrogen-fuel ecosystem costs five to 10 times more than electric infrastructures. The most important difference is: I charge my Tesla at home; you’ll not be able to do that with a hydrogen fuel-cell car. So frankly, it’s an uneconomic idea. Toyota has not had success with its hydrogen fuel-cell car. I don’t know why we should believe it will be successful for trucks.

You wrote to Elon Musk in 2018 to dissuade him from taking the company private. Is there a risk that great innovative companies could remain privately held for longer?

Companies that are staying private for so long are spending too much time getting ready for their liquidity event, prettying things up—and they’re losing strategic focus. Good cases in point are Uber and Lyft. By all rights, they should have the autonomous-taxi network opportunity; they should be in the pole position. But they’re nowhere [close to that]. In fact, their stocks have been cut almost in half since the IPO—even before the coronavirus. If they had started outfitting the cars of their drivers, they could have much more data today than Tesla. The name of the game in the autonomous world is, who is going to have the most real-world driving data and the highest quality data, along with the best AI expertise. They don’t, because they weren’t thinking about this, but they should have been.

What else do you like?

If we’re going to bring supply chains closer to home, 3D printing. Even though it’s had a very slow start and is exclusive to the aerospace area, adoption will accelerate because it’s so much cheaper and faster, and you can manufacture very close to the end consumer. Another area is industrial robots. Collaborative robots, in particular, are covered with sensors, so they can work alongside human beings. That’s especially relevant now that human beings are going to have to socially distance a bit more.

Thanks, Cathie.

So far this earnings season, just two S&P stocks from the auto sector, namely PACCAR PCAR and Genuine Parts GPC, came up with quarterly numbers. Various other auto firms including the red-hot electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla TSLA, auto retailers namely Lithia Motors, Penske Automotive and AutoNation, as well as recreational vehicle maker Winnebago WGO unveiled quarterly numbers. Encouragingly, all the above-mentioned companies managed to deliver earnings beat.

Meanwhile, U.S. auto giant General Motors GM grabbed limelight as it continues to step up its EV game. The firm announced plans to spend $2 billion to convert the Tennessee assembly plant to manufacture green vehicles. It also unveiled the first look of 2022 GMC Hummer EV sport utility truck. On the contrary, Harley-Davidson HOG recalled more than 1,000 LiveWire bikes in the United States.

Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories

1. Tesla reported stellar results for third-quarter 2020, posting profit for the fifth consecutive quarter. The company reported earnings of 76 cents, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents per share. The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago earnings of 37 cents a share. Total revenues came in at $8,771 million, surpassing the consensus mark of $8,225 million. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 39%. Tesla has maintained the target of 500K deliveries for full-year 2020. Importantly, the firm generated free cash flow of $1,395 million during the quarter. The metric compared favorably with $418 million and $371 million recorded in the prior quarter and the year-ago period, respectively. (Tesla Q3 Earnings Beat, '20 Delivery Target Intact)

2. General Motors recently announced the decision to invest $2 billion in its Spring Hill, TN assembly plant. This will facilitate the transition of the assembly plant to become the company’s third vehicle production facility for manufacturing electric vehicles (EV).Its two existing EV manufacturing plants are Factory Zero in Detroit and Hamtramck, MI, and Orion Assembly in Orion Township, MI. The new luxury Cadillac LYRIQ will be the first EV to be manufactured at Spring Hill, along with the conventional combustion engine-powered Cadillac XT6 and XT5 luxury SUV crossovers, making the plant at Spring Hill not 100% electric, unlike the Factory Zero and Orion Assembly plants.

3. Harley-Davidson recently issued a voluntary safety recall for certain 2020 LiveWire electric motorcycles due to a potential software defect. Per National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall has been issued due to reports that a few of the 2020 LiveWire motorcycles have electric powertrains that unexpectedly initiate a shutdown without providing a clear notification to the rider that the shutdown sequence has started. In some cases, the vehicle does not restart after the sudden shutdown due to a software defect in the Onboard Charging system.It is estimated that about 1,012 bikes have been recalled by the company for a software update in lieu of customers’ interests and safety.

15,2020-10-26,07:00:00,TSLA,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robotaxis-still-distant-dream-lidar-110000086.html,"With Robotaxis Still a Distant Dream, Lidar Makes Itself Useful","(Bloomberg) -- The promise of self-driving cars and robotaxi fleets once seemed just around the corner, but reality is setting in. Makers of the underlying technology are pivoting to more realistic ways of making money in the here and now.

Among the most expensive components of autonomous vehicles are laser-based sensors that allow a car’s computer to “see” its surroundings. As automakers push back timelines for introducing self-driving models, companies that specialize in these laser sensors, known as lidar, are targeting more limited features for passenger cars that will go into production in a few years. That’s a shift from the driverless fleets once at the center of manufacturers’ strategies.

Companies are betting they can make this business model work by whittling down the cost of laser sensors, which can reach thousands of dollars. That would make it affordable enough for automakers introducing semi-autonomous features such as hands-free highway driving. Lidar is becoming more familiar to consumers, too, and is a feature of higher-end versions of Apple Inc.’s new iPhone 12.

Lidar startups have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, seizing on demand for high-tech auto investments. Luminar Technologies Inc.’s 25-year-old founder is set to become one of the world’s youngest billionaires when it completes a reverse merger later this year, and Velodyne Lidar Inc. went public via reverse merger last month.

The game plan is to generate revenue on the long road to full autonomy, said Grayson Brulte, who runs a consulting firm in Palm Beach, Florida, focused on autonomous vehicles.“The only way in the current mobility market for autonomy or semi-autonomy to show revenue growth is ADAS,” said Brulte, using industry parlance for partial autonomy, or Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. “As higher levels of autonomy mature, then you can start to have that additional revenue growth.”

Surge in Sensors

The market for lidar sensors in light-duty vehicles could reach $46 billion in sales by 2030, with much of that going to enable partial autonomy, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst with Guidehouse Insights, a research company. A lot of that volume will come from makers of low-cost lidar sensors, including Continental AG and radar supplier Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH, he said.

Story continues

Innoviz Technologies Ltd., an Israeli startup backed by two of the world’s largest auto suppliers, Aptiv Plc and Magna International Inc., is pitching its latest sensors as a cheaper way for automakers to start phasing in more-sophisticated technology because it allows for upgrades as self-driving systems become more capable and widespread.

Innoviz supplies lidar for BMW AG’s iNext car due in 2021, which will gradually introduce so-called Level 3 autonomy, meaning drivers will be able to take their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road in limited circumstances.

“This is really solving a big problem,” said Omer Keilaf, the company’s chief executive officer.

Most self-driving developers consider lidar a critical safety layer that will enable cars to assume responsibility on highways, freeing up drivers to check email or watch a movie. It’s a big leap from Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot or General Motors Co.’s Super Cruise driver-assistance systems, which require motorists to keep their eyes and minds on the road even if their hands are off the wheel.

Gathering Data

Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk famously dismisses lidar, has been gathering self-driving data for years by installing its camera-and-radar-based driver-assistance system on its cars. Last week, Tesla began rolling out a beta version of what it calls “Full Self-Driving” to some of its biggest fans and influencers to try out. Musk plans to charge $10,000 a pop for the package, which Tesla claims is advanced enough to use when driving on busy city streets -- not just on highways.

Tesla didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.

Despite its name -- and Musk’s promises -- the system does not offer full self-driving. Federal regulators are probing deadly crashes involving Autopilot, and critics have slammed the company for rolling it out prematurely.

Keilaf says Innoviz’s approach would be safer than Tesla’s, because lidar -- which works well in low-light conditions -- would serve as a backup for cameras and radar.

His company’s latest iteration will cost $500 per unit when produced at high volumes, Keilaf said. That is closer to the $40 to $50 per-unit cost for radar sensors and $10 to $15 for cameras, several of which are typically installed on each vehicle, Abuelsamid said.

Holy Grail Delayed

Luminar, which agreed to go public in a $3.4 billion reverse merger earlier this year, is supplying lidar for Volvo Car AB’s self-driving system that will be installed on cars starting in 2022. Dubbed Highway Pilot, it won’t require drivers to keep their eyes on the road at all times.“It will likely take hundreds of thousands of vehicles to enable autonomy,” Luminar CEO Austin Russell wrote in a letter to investors earlier this month. “That scale is exactly what we can deliver with series production on consumer vehicles.”

Adding lidar will be lucrative for automakers because they can charge thousands of dollars more for the option of advanced autonomous features, Russell said in an interview.

The industry’s focus on mass-production of passenger cars is a shift from a few years ago, when companies including Innoviz and Velodyne had trained their sights on AV test fleets. Since then, GM has delayed the rollout of its robotaxi service, while Ford Motor Co.’s former CEO said last year that the industry had overestimated the arrival of self-driving cars.

“If you talk to anybody about three to four years ago, everyone was working on this holy grail of autonomy,” Velodyne CEO Anand Gopalan said in an interview.

Pandemic Threat

Now driver-assist systems represent about 35% of the projects Velodyne has won or hopes to win in the next five years, while AVs and industrial robots make up about a 20% slice each.

High-tech suppliers may be wise to hedge their automotive bets. With fallout from pandemic-related shutdowns and the looming threat of a resurgence, global vehicle sales will be down 14% this year compared with pre-Covid-19 estimates and 22% lower than expected in 2021, according to LMC Automotive.

Velodyne’s Gopalan acknowledged the drop in sales could dampen automakers’ enthusiasm for pricey parts but said lidar remains critical for development of fully automated cars.

“With uncertainties in the marketplace, you may see certain delays,” he said. “But we don’t see a loss of appetite for the tech and the goal.”

Three numbers to start your day:

Huge Recall of Teslas in China

30,000 Tesla vehicles are being recalled in China, according to a report from Bloomberg.

The recall includes Model S and Model X vehicles that were made in the U.S. between 2013 and 2018. The recall was initiated because of suspension defects.

Tesla has told U.S. regulators that the recall wasn’t necessary and that the problems with the cars were caused by “driver abuse.”"

With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

During the company's third-quarter earnings call last week, an analyst took a stab at getting CEO Elon Musk to talk about vehicle delivery expectations for next year -- and he succeeded.

As it turns out, Tesla may be positioned for massive growth in vehicle deliveries in 2021 -- and the automaker has the installed production capacity to back it up.

Tesla deliveries may skyrocket

After explaining how he arrived at his estimate, New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu he believed Tesla could deliver between 840,000 to one million cars in 2021 -- up from the projected 500,000 units the company is expected to deliver this year.

When asked whether he was on the right track, Musk responded saying, ""I mean, it's in that vicinity. Yes. You're not far off.""

To put this potential growth into perspective, consider it in percentage terms compared to the 500,000 vehicles Tesla is aiming to deliver this year. Growing deliveries from 500,000 in 2020 to 850,000 in 2021 implies 70% year over year growth. One million deliveries next year, of course, would translate to 100% growth (again assuming Tesla delivers 500,000 vehicles in 2020.

How Tesla's deliveries could grow 70%

But are these realistic expectations?

There's actually a rational case for this analyst's projections. As the analyst pointed out when explaining the reasoning for his forecast, the automaker has already installed enough production capacity to produce nearly 850,000 cars per year.

Tesla broke down this capacity in its third-quarter shareholder letter. The company's production lines at its Fremont, California factory can produce 90,0000 combined Model S and X units per year and 500,000 combined Model 3 and Y units. Tesla's new Shanghai factory has the capacity for 250,000 Model 3 vehicles annually.

Meanwhile, Tesla's Model Y factories in both Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas are both under construction. In addition, the company is building a production line for Model Y in Shanghai. Given Tesla's recent accelerated pace at bringing factories and new production lines online, it wouldn't be surprising to see production at these factories begin in meaningful volumes next year.

While Tesla could run into some unexpected detours, the company's recent execution and its expansion plans suggest Tesla will likely see accelerated growth next year."

The market rally suffered further losses last week, but the major indexes and leading stocks found support and pared losses.

Wall Street is heading into the peak week of earnings. Along with Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft stock, Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), AMD (AMD), Shopify (SHOP), Twilio (TWLO), ServiceNow (NOW) among the hundreds of companies reporting. It's the last full week before the presidential election. New coronavirus cases are breaking records in the U.S. and Europe, but Covid vaccine news could come any day. And stimulus deal hopes and doubts remain.

All of this is taking place with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq at key levels. The major indexes and many leaders, such as Microsoft stock, Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Tesla (TSLA), could offer buying opportunities with a good day or two. But one or two bad sessions could trigger serious concerns about the stock market rally.

Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks

Leaderboard Stocks

Tesla, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce stock are all on IBD Leaderboard.

Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe stock also are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Unlike Apple and Amazon stock, which are not Long-Term Leaders, these three software giants are all holding above their 10-week moving averages. The 10-week line is a good place to buy Long-Term Leaders, but investors should wait to see a little more strength in these stocks, as well as the market rally. Microsoft earnings also loom.

Meanwhile, Tesla stock also has found support near its 10-week line, with buy points or sell signals not far away. It's hard to believe it, but the Tesla news cycle might quiet down for a time.

The Latest IBD/TIPP Trump Vs. Biden Tracking Poll

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures fell 1.15% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.95%.

Along with the surge in coronavirus cases, stalled stimulus deal talks also could influence Dow Jones futures. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday blamed President Trump for the lack of a stimulus deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been stimulus deal talks with Pelosi, said the White House has offered compromises but the Speaker is ""dug in.""

The House is already out while the Senate will leave town on Monday, after the likely confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. While Congress could be called back to vote on a stimulus deal, that seems unlikely with election campaigns in the final stretch.

Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 GOP senator, said Sunday that he hopes a stimulus deal can be passed after the election.

Meanwhile, German software giant SAP (SAP) on Sunday cut its full-year revenue and operating profit forecasts, saying the coronavirus pandemic will hurt demand ""at least"" through mid-2021. SAP did beat Q3 profit views, though revenue missed.

SAP stock plunged roughly 20% in premarket trading.

Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.

Coronavirus Cases

Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 43.43 million, according to Worldometers. Daily coronavirus cases worldwide are approaching half a million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.16 million.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 8.88 million, with deaths above 230,000.

Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short and political adviser Marty Obst have tested positive for the coronavirus. NBC News reported at two more Pence aides have tested positive for the coronavirus, while ABC News said a total of five people in the vice president's ""orbit"" have tested positive.

Pence, who has tested negative again, has decided not to quarantine and will continue campaigning.

The U.S. added 81,210 new coronavirus cases on Friday, a new daily record, followed by 79,449 on Saturday. That's partly due to increased testing from earlier in the year, but positive test results are rising sharply as well. Coronavirus restrictions have eased from earlier in the year, but the biggest factor may be Americans weary of following social distancing and mask rules.

Several European countries have been hitting daily records, with Spain and France now with more than one million Covid-19 cases in total. Much of Europe has reimposed tougher coronavirus restrictions, but not much in U.S. cities and states so far.

If coronavirus restrictions are reimposed, that could stall a relatively solid economic recovery. That would likely add pressure for a new stimulus deal.

Coronavirus death rates remain relatively low, reflecting better treatments and procedures and the lag between infection and fatalities. Hospitalizations for the coronavirus have risen sharply, however.

Coronavirus Vaccine News Soon?

Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) and partner BioNTech (BNTX) could release interim effectiveness data on their coronavirus vaccine candidate from final-stage trials any day, with a possible FDA approval request by late November. Moderna (MRNA) could follow a few weeks later.

In a best-case scenario, millions of coronavirus vaccine doses will be out before year-end, targeting those most at risk. But it would still take many months to vaccinate most Americans.

Both Pfizer and Moderna report earnings this coming week.

The AstraZeneca (AZN) Covid-19 vaccine reportedly produces a robust antibody and T-cell immune response in elderly people. The U.S. part of AstraZeneca's final-stage trial finally resumed Friday following a severe reaction by one participant.

A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine also has resumed late-stage trials after a brief pause over a participant's illness. The J&J Covid-19 vaccine candidate is one of the few that would require just a single dose.

Stock Market Rally Last Week

U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 28336.62 -27.04 -0.10 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3465.59 +12.10 +0.35 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 11548.28 +42.28 +0.37 Russell 2000 (IWM) 162.98 +0.85 +0.52 IBD 50 (FFTY) 38.33 +0.30 +0.79 Last Update: 4:04 PM ET 10/23/2020

The stock market rally continued to slide, though the major indexes all found support at their 21-day exponential moving averages.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite slid 1.1%, but held its ground after tumbling 1.65% on Monday.

Apple stock fell 3.3%, closing near weekly lows. Amazon sank 2.1%. Microsoft sank 1.6%, but has now risen for the past four sessions. Salesforce retreated 3.1%. Adobe fell back 2.85%, but rallied Friday to get just above its 10-week line. Tesla stock sank 4.3%.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 2.7%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) lost 1.3%, with Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe all major components. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 1.4%.

Long-Term Leaders Near Buy Points

A good time to buy Long-Term Leaders is near their 10-week moving averages. Dow Jones stocks Microsoft and Salesforce rebounded from their 10-week lines this week, while Adobe reclaims that key level Friday.

But you want to see these stocks decisively break short trend lines in their handles, with similar action in the major indexes. But if these stocks are moving decisively higher, the Nasdaq likely will show positive action as well.

In the case of Dow Jones giant Microsoft, investors should wait until after its Tuesday night earnings.

Microsoft and Adobe fell about 1% early Monday. Salesforce stock lost nearly 2%.

Tesla Stock

After trying to break past an early entry on Oct. 14, Tesla stock has retreated, undercutting its 50-day and 10-week line on Friday but closing above those line.

Especially n a weekly chart, TSLA stock looks fine. It's been consolidating relatively tightly over the past several weeks and is once again finding support at the 10-week line. It's also forged a handle with a 466 buy point. Aggressive investors could use 445.33, just above Thursday's intraday high, as an early entry.

On the other hand, if Tesla decisively breaks below its 10-week line, investors may want to consider paring gains.

Over the last couple of months, there were several expected catalysts for Tesla stock: S&P 500 inclusion, Battery Day, Q3 deliveries and Q3 earnings. S&P inclusion hasn't happened while the other there events didn't drive TSLA stock higher. Then again, they haven't sunk the stock either.

Tesla stock fell 2% early Monday.

Tesla News About To Get Boring?

No, that's not a reference to Tesla sister company Boring.

In the next few weeks, the Tesla news cycle may actually quiet down. Sure, there is plenty going on. Tesla is exporting Model 3 cars from its Shanghai plant to Europe, taking over somewhat for the Fremont, Calif., plant.

In a new SEC filing Monday, Tesla said it expects capital spending in 2020 to be at the high end of its target range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. Capex already picked up in Q3. It sees capex of $4.5 billion to $6 billion in 2021 and 2022.

Tesla could cut the Model 3 prices in the U.S. in the coming weeks, after recently slashing Model 3 prices in China and cutting Model S prices.

No doubt, Elon Musk and Tesla will keep themselves in the public eye. The Full Self Driving beta launch is getting a lot of attention, with Tesla raising the FSD price to $10,000 on Monday even as critics note the Level 2 system's shortcomings.

But on paper, Tesla has few key ""circle that date"" events over the last couple of months. The Model Y will soon launch in China, though perhaps not until the start of 2021. Meanwhile, the Ford Mustang Mach E, a Model Y competitor, will launch in the U.S. before year-even. The VW ID.4, another Model Y rival, will start global deliveries around the start of the year.

So all of those events, along with Tesla's Q4 deliveries, herald a new round of headlines and the beginning of a critical year for the electric car industry.

These 4 Stocks Are Trading Bullishly, Offering New Buy Points

Stock Market Analysis

Heading into last week, there were reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Sure, the major indexes had pulled back, a little, but that was allowing many tech giants to form handles.

Then on Monday, Oct. 19, the major indexes suffered sharp losses, with growth names harder hit. After a couple of modest days, stocks undercut their 21-day lines in Thursday's session, with the 50-day line not far past that. Thankfully, the major indexes rebounded for slim gains, followed by Friday's rally into the close.

Arguably, the stock market rally is a good day or two from looking bullish again. Breaking the short trend lines in the Nasdaq would be a positive sign. Then again, it would only take a day or two for the market rally to look bearish, testing or undercutting 50-day lines.

Dow Jones futures suggest that the major indexes will test or undercut their 21-day lines at Monday's open, with the Dow itself sinking to around its 50-day line.

Game Plan The Market Rally

Analyze your stocks. A lot of mixed action in growth names this week. You might have cut back your exposure but still grade your current holdings. Several of your stocks may have earnings due in the next few days. Do you have enough of a cushion heading into results?

Build up your watch lists. There are a lot of good-looking charts. Many just need one push, whether from individual earnings or broad market strength, to flash clear buying signals. So you want to be ready.

Let The Stock Market Trend Be Your Friend

But while the stock market rally hasn't done anything seriously wrong over the past two weeks, it hasn't been a good environment for making money.

Earnings season is usually enough chaos for your portfolio. But this headline-driven stock market rally has so headlines to deal with right now: the presidential election, coronavirus vaccine news, stimulus deal talks. Coronavirus cases are front-and-center once again. All could swing the market one way or the other in the next few weeks.

Don't get too exposed. Wait for the market to show clear positive direction. That could happen in the next few days or weeks. There will be many breakouts and other buying opportunities if the market takes off again. If market heads lower, new buys are likely to struggle.

Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.
