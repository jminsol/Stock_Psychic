Stock Market Rally: What To Do Next  An uptrend under pressure means investors need to be much more cautious, but not go entirely to cash. Watch sell signals closely. Be sure to sell any stock that falls 7% or 8% from your purchase price, and maybe even 3% or 4% if you want to raise cash.  Avoid buying stocks for now, unless the breakout is exceptionally good. The best candidates are those that proved most resilient during the recent stock market weakness. Keep a close eye on stocks with strong relative strength lines. These ideas could become stock market leaders.  Use MarketSmith features like the RS Line Blue Dot to easily spot such stock candidates. The RS Line Blue Dot is assigned to stocks whose RS lines are making new highs while the stock is basing or breaking out.

On the one hand, there is the fear of missing out on more returns in the equity market. On the other, is elevated anxiety about the outcome and aftermath of the election and what that will do to their portfolios. Those are among the key takeaways from our recent survey of Investopedia readers, the fifth we have conducted since before the coronavirus was named a global pandemic.  Caught in the Neutral Zone  While our readers are slightly less bullish than they were in August, they are also slightly less bearish than they were in the summer. Since then, economies have opened up and growth is strong across most industries – although the labor market remains compromised – yet the virus is still very present in everyday life. Equity markets have trudged higher after rebounding out of the fastest bear market in history, and that has caused some concerns about stretched valuations in some stocks and sectors.  The Election is the Overhang  The upcoming election remains the dominant concern among our readers. While they are split on who they think will win the election, they remain concerned about the impact it will have on their portfolios. They are also concerned about what will happen in the aftermath of the election and whether it will be contested and peaceful.  Staying the Course  Despite their worries, only one quarter of our survey respondents, who range in age and income across the U.S., are making changes to their portfolios. Most are sticking with the stocks and strategies that have carried them through this tumultuous year. Their favorite stocks (listed below) show that they have chosen wisely and safely.  Of those who are making portfolio changes, older investors are becoming more conservative. They are moving more into cash and sticking with many of the same blue chip dividend-paying stocks they’ve held for years. Younger investors have also stayed loyal to their favorite stocks, while both younger and older investors still favor the technology and health care sectors.  Too Far, Too Fast?  62% of our survey respondents, regardless of age, think the stock market has become overvalued. 71% believe that the economy and the stock market are disconnected and 54% anticipate it could experience another significant drop in the next three months. The reasons for that are as described: The election, its aftermath, and the possibility of another economic shutdown.  They are also slightly concerned about President Trump’s use of social media as a communications tool and its impact on the stock market, as well as his health and the health of his administration. We fielded the survey just as the president tested positive for COVID-19 and was subsequently hospitalized.  Investors Keep the Faith in Their Favorite Stocks  Our readers have proven to be faithful investors when it comes to their portfolios. The top 10 holdings have remained fairly consistent throughout the pandemic, although there is variation among the different age groups of our readers. But the top three holdings – Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) – are also among the most widely held stocks in index funds, ETFs, hedge funds, endowments, and among retail investors.  Older investors have held onto their favorite dividend paying stocks like Bank of America (BAC) and Verizon (VZ), as well as traditional media companies like Disney (DIS). Tesla (TSLA) investors are nothing if not loyal and they have stuck with the electric car maker through many peaks and valleys, although 2020 has mostly been peaks.  What’s Next?  The next few months are a big question mark for investors. The election is the obvious elephant in the room, but beyond that, the resurgence of the virus and another potential lockdown, concerns about social unrest, and the widening disconnect between the capital markets and the economy will cloud the horizon. Individual investors, like our readers, have different time horizons and goals for investing than institutional investors. They can mostly afford to be patient until the smoke clears on any one or all of those issues. Until then, expect them to stay in the neutral zone."

LOS ANGELES, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Former ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart will host and produce a new current affairs series for Apple Inc s streaming television service, the company announced on Tuesday.
The multi-season series on Apple TV+ will bring the comedian back to TV on a regular basis for the first time since he ended his Emmy-winning run as host of ""The Daily Show"" in 2015.
No debut date for the untitled series was announced. Apple said in a statement that each one-hour episode would address a single issue and explore topics related to current events and Stewart s advocacy work.
The issues also will be discussed in a companion podcast, the company said.
Stewart’s irreverent brand of political and media satire made him a beloved figure on television with influence far beyond the 2 to 3 million nightly audience of ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central.
Since leaving the ""Daily Show,"" Stewart has appeared occasionally on talk shows and this year released a political comedy film called ""Irresistible"" that he wrote and directed.
He also has advocated for wounded veterans and for healthcare benefits for first responders who became ill after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He and his wife, Tracey, opened a farm sanctuary in New Jersey.
Stewart s new series is part of a multi-year agreement with Apple to develop and produce projects for Apple TV+, a $5-a-month competitor to subscription video services from companies such as Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co ."

X  S&P 500 Falls, Nasdaq Rallies  The S&P 500 closed down by 0.3% in a choppy day which saw it turn positive several times. Meanwhile the tech-heavy Nasdaq was the only positive major index after rising by 0.6%. The move allowed it to pull slightly above its 50-day moving average, a key technical support level.  Volume was down in the choppy session. Trading volume slipped by around 5.5% on the NYSE vs. Monday, according to early data. It also fell by around 7.8% on the Nasdaq.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) was up around 0.7%, but remains shy of its 50-day line.  In contrast, financials and industrials were the worst performing sectors. Both the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) and the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN) knifed below their 50-day average after both slipped around 2% each.  The Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) managed to rally somewhat, rising by 0.4%. Among the IBD 50 stocks, winners included Futu (FUTU), which rose 2.9% and Veeva Systems (VEEV), which was up 1.9%. Losers included Teradyne (TER), which was down 2.4% and Entegris (ENTG), which lost 0.6%.  Apple Stock Rise Not Enough For Dow Jones  It was a tough day for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with a late rally not enough to stop it from closing down 0.8%.  Old rivals Apple and Microsoft were among the day s big winners on the index. Apple stock was up 1.4%, but remains below its 50-day line. Microsoft fared better thanks to a 1.5% rise, managing to punch through its 50-day moving average. Microsoft shares were up less than 1% after the close, on the company s earnings report. Salesforce (CRM) fared best, rising 3.6%.  There were far more losers than winners however. Boeing (BA) fared worst after diving 3.5%, but was closely followed by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which surrendered 3.3% and Caterpillar (CAT), which slipped 3.2%  Tinder Parent Catches Fire, Leads Breakouts  A trio of stocks managed to break out Tuesday, despite the difficult conditions.  They were led by Tinder parent Match (MTC). The stock passed a buy point of 123.10 in above-average volume. Its relative strength line hit a fresh high, which is encouraging. Match stock has a strong Composite Rating of 94, though its EPS Rating of 69 is not ideal.  A potential catalyst for the stock is imminent, with the firm slated to report Q3 earnings Wednesday Nov. 4, after the close. Rather than buying a stock before earnings, IBD recommends using options as a strategy to limit risk. It s a way to capitalize on the upside potential of a stock s move around earnings, while reducing the downside risk.  Health care mobile communications stock Vocera Communications (VCRA) also closed in a buy zone after passing a cup-with-handle buy point of 33.77. Its RS line also hit a fresh high. It has a Composite Rating of 95.  Surgical imaging systems stock Hologic (HOLX) also closed in a buy zone. It passed a cup-with-handle buy point of 69.81. It has a Composite Rating of 91.  Big Losers Outnumber Winners  The market saw a number of stocks making big price moves on unusually heavy volume, with losers outnumbering winners.  Stocks that had good up days included Shutterstock (SSTK), which rose around 11.8%; investment firm Cowen (COWN), which swelled 5.4%, and Laboratory Corp. of America (LH), which rose 2.2%.  Losers included online education stock Chegg (CHGG), which plummeted 11%, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which slipped 4.1%, and Dexcom (DXCM), which surrendered 8.9%.

Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter results demonstrating that the company is strong, financially healthy and well positioned for growth. Sales were $3 billion, up 16% sequentially. EPS grew 72% sequentially to $0.43, as higher sales and strong manufacturing execution resulted in operating margin expanding to 18.3%, up 710 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year.  We generated $518 million of free cash flow and finished the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash. Our financial performance has improved significantly since April, and we expect a strong fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we remain vigilant and continue to adapt appropriately to multiple disruptive forces playing out around the world from the pandemic, the civil unrest to recession and geopolitical struggles. We ve been rising to the challenges since day one, and our priorities remain clear.  First, we must make our values evident in our actions. Our commitment to the health, safety, and well-being of our employees underlines every facet of our operations. We re dedicating resources and providing leadership to support our communities around the world. We ve launched Unity campaigns as well as racial and social equality programs targeting the multitude of hardships people are confronting right now.  And when it comes to the global health fight, we re all in, mobilizing our capabilities to combat the virus directly. We must also safeguard our financial health. Our third-quarter results show that our decisive actions are providing clear benefits as we leverage cost savings and increase efficiencies across the company. Regardless of the depth or duration of global uncertainty, we re doing everything in our power to keep the company strong, and it s working.  Now to ensure that we emerge even stronger, we re continuing to invest to create additional revenue streams. We re inventing new-to-the-world materials and manufacturing processes as well as co-innovating new solutions in partnership with our customers. The relevance of our portfolio puts Corning at the heart of ongoing innovation with industry leaders, and we continue to solve our customers  toughest technology challenges. You may have seen Apple s recent promotion of ceramic shield for the iPhone 12.  Their featuring are new-to-the-world material, which is the world s first, highly transparent color-free glass ceramic with performance that meets the rigorous demands put on smartphone cover materials. This latest innovation with Apple exemplifies our ongoing strategy of consistent, long-term value creation by combining our deep expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our unparalleled manufacturing and engineering capabilities. Ceramic shield melds the attributes that we love about glass, create optics and retain strength with the attributes we love about ceramics, most notably, it s toughness. Ceramics shield consist of ceramic crystals within a glass matrix.  There were two big inventions here. The first was keeping the best damage-resistant attributes of both glass and ceramics. The second was ensuring high optical transparency by growing index-matched nanocrystals inside the glass matrix that are one-tenth the wavelength of late. As you recall, Apple made two investments in Corning, totaling $450 million, as part of their advanced manufacturing fund and their commitment to foster innovation among American manufacturers.  We thank Apple for our long-standing product development partnership and their investments in new manufacturing technology centered in our Harrisburg, Kentucky facility. We could not be prouder to be a key component in the iPhone 12. Now, it s important to note the iPhone 12, and many other flagship phones that we are also proud to be part of, support 5G. 5G matters to us.  The density of fiber necessary to deliver its promise is yet another example. You ve seen us illustrate that up to 100x more fiber is required to deploy 5G in a city than 4G. This week, we announced a new product design to help operators dramatically boost the speed and reduce the cost of their outdoor deployments. And we re embarking on new work to support Verizon s efforts to extend 5G indoors.  The relevance of our portfolio and our deep customer relationships, as illustrated by these advancements, keep us at the center of the inexorable shift to optical. Stepping back, in all the industries we serve, important market trends offer new challenges. The Corning is uniquely qualified to address and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into products. This is an especially powerful value creation lever in times of economic uncertainty, because we aren t exclusively relying on people buying more stuff.  We re putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. We are clearly seeing the benefits of this lever in today s results as innovation adoption drove specialty materials sales up 23% year-over-year despite a declining smartphone market. This type of outperformance is not unique. From 2016 to 2019, we added $500 million in sales, or 42% cumulatively, while smartphone sales actually went down.  And we re extending that growth streak this year. In environmental technologies, we grew sales 16% in 2019, much faster than the underlying unit demand as automakers added gas particulate filters to cars. And we, again, saw outperformance this quarter with sequential sales up 68%. These are additional examples of the more Corning strategy at work and why the content story is so powerful for us.  I want to stress one additional point. You often hear us say that our core technologies enable life-changing capabilities. In these times, we re increasing focus on life-saving innovations. Safe widespread vaccine delivery is one of society s top priorities, and glass packaging is critical.  Our Valor innovation will help enable faster filling line speeds and increased patient safety. Right now, we re expanding capacity and supplying glass vials for vaccines as part of operation work speed, all while leveraging our leadership in life sciences to help support COVID diagnostic testing and virus research efforts. Additionally, reduced fine particulate pollution, the objective of our filtration products, appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates. And we re excited about recent university lab test, showing that our guardian antimicrobial glass particles, kill bacteria and viruses, including SARS-COV2.  We re also well-positioned to contribute as consumers continue to adapt to a world with social distancing. For example, fiber increases the capacity and performance of networks, and glass provides the primary window to information and entertainment. We re confident that we can bring further innovations to bear in many vital areas as the world addresses and recovers from these current challenges. Overall, we had a very strong quarter on almost every dimension.  From an innovation perspective, I just reviewed our significant advancements. Financially, we grew sales at double-digit rate sequentially and expanded margins to grow profitability even faster. Operationally, we performed well, and I d like to share a few examples. In the midst of the pandemic, we deployed expert engineering teams to start-up our Gen 10.5 melting operations in both Wuhan and Guangzhou.  These facilities are positioning on us well to capture the fast-growing demand for large TVs. In mobile consumer electronics, we successfully scaled up a new-to-the-world manufacturing process and product to meet Apple s iPhone launch. In automotive, we flexed our operations to adjust to the fast pace ramp-up at OEMs after they significantly reduced production in Quarter 2. In optical communications, we successfully adjusted our cost to the current market environment, resulting in significant profitability expansion, despite flattish sales, on a quarter-over-quarter basis.  We also remain vigilant in our actions to safeguard the company s financial strength. We re proud of our execution, especially given the current global uncertainties. Clearly, our employees around the world are dedicated to living our values and giving their best every day. Now, I ll turn the call over to Tony, so he can give you some more insights on the quarter.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Thank you, Wendell, and good morning. We had a very strong third quarter. As Wendell highlighted, we executed effectively, and we bolstered our healthy balance sheet despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Sales growth and cost actions led to strong sequential margin expansion, further demonstrating that our operational adjustments are working.  We ve made significant adjustments to align our cost and operating plan with the lower anticipated sales. In total, Corning continues to demonstrate that it has the resources to deliver on our commitments and extend our leadership as we continue to focus on operational excellence, cash flow generation, and prudent capital allocation. Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to call out the changes at Hemlock during Q3 and cover the differences between GAAP and core results. On September 9, Hemlock Semiconductor group redeemed DuPont s 40.25% ownership interest in the company, which transformed Corning s longtime ownership in Hemlock into a majority position.  In the second transaction, Hemlock purchased certain manufacturing assets from DuPont and gained control of a critical raw material, thereby becoming a leading, low-cost producer of ultra-pure polysilicon to the semiconductor industry. Hemlock s leadership position is backed by attractive the long-term take-or-pay customer contracts with upfront payments. Now, we re very excited about these transactions. They are good for Hemlock, good for Corning, and good for our shareholders.  We didn t put any money into the transaction, and Hemlock generates a lot of cash so its debt is mostly paid back in one year. Corning improves its financials by adding sales and earnings. In the third quarter, we recognized $31 million of sales from the newly consolidated Hemlock. And Hemlock will add approximately $150 million in annual cash flow.  Please see our web disclosure for helpful consolidation details. Now on to GAAP. The largest differences between our third-quarter GAAP and core results are a noncash gain associated with the Hemlock transaction, ongoing restructuring charges, which are primarily noncash, and a mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. Now with respect to the mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter.  For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q3 by $103 million. To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions. Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant-currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions.  We re very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. We ve received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since our inception more than five years ago. Now, I ll walk through our third quarter performance. At the outset of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger.  In Q1 and Q2, we told you we were responding to economic uncertainty by making significant operational adjustments. We said we reduced cost and capital spend to align with lower anticipated sales. And while ramping down production and reducing inventory impacts margins, we said that when sales growth resumed, we expect improved profitability. Now, looking at the third quarter, we grew 16% -- sales grew 16% sequentially to $3 billion, and our operating margin expanded by 710 basis points sequentially, to 18.3%.  This resulted in net income of $380 million and EPS of $0.43, up 72% sequentially. We also said we would maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year. In the third quarter, free cash flow grew to $518 million, cumulative free cash flow for the first three quarters was $484 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and expect to generate additional positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce cost, control inventory and execute well overall.  As a result, I m confident that we will succeed on our free cash flow goals. These actions -- the actions we re taking are clearly working. We have delivered great operational improvements, which started to show results in Q2, and really accelerated in Q3. We expect the benefit of these actions to continue in Q4, contributing to another strong quarter.  Now, let s review the business segments. In display technologies, third quarter sales were $827 million, up 10% sequentially, and net income was $196 million, up 29% sequentially. Display glass volume grew approximately 10% sequentially, as panel makers increase utilization, resulting in strong incrementals. Sequential price declines were moderate, as expected.  From an end-market perspective, it appears that the impact from COVID-19 has been a positive. In developed markets, consumers are prioritizing in-home entertainment. Globally, work and study from home trends are growing. This is increasing demand for TV and IT products.  On the other hand, smartphone demand has been down. In total, the retail market, as measured in square feet of glass, is up mid-single digits year-to-date through August. Of course, the upcoming holiday retail season will be a big factor in how the market actually plays out for the full year. Longer term, we remain confident that TV screen size will continue to grow.  TVs at 65 inches or larger grew 40% year-to-date through August. And we are well positioned to capture the majority of that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. We continue to expect display pricing to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2020. We believe that three factors drive a favorable glass pricing environment: First, we expect glass supply/demand to be balanced to tight.  For Corning, we are ramping our Gen 10.5 tanks to align with panel makers  schedules. Second, our competitors continue to face profitability challenges at current pricing levels. And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations. Glass prices must support acceptable returns on those investments.  In optical communications, third-quarter sales grew 10% sequentially to $909 million, as carrier spending and deployments remain stable and enterprise sales grew slightly. Net income grew by $34 million or 42% to $115 million, driven by improving cost performance. Looking forward, demand on the network is at an all-time high, and we are seeing positive statements on capacity expansion from network operators. Currently, COVID-related factors hampered the ability to invest broadly in networks, and operators are focusing efforts on addressing capacity bottlenecks.  We believe operators will begin additional investments to reestablish normal network headroom and expand offerings. Large-carrier and enterprise capital projects are inevitable. But as we ve said before, it s always hard to predict the timing. Environmental technology sales in the third quarter were $379 million, up 68% sequentially as markets recovered and OEMs continued to adopt GPS in Europe and China.  We effectively adjusted our operations to pace with the market recovery and delivered net income of $69 million, compared to breakeven in the second quarter. The business team did a great job over the last six months in reacting to the rapid shutdown and restart of auto production by controlling cost and maintaining flexibility. Automotive sales increased 1% year-over-year as continued strong adoption of GPS helped us exceed vehicle production, which declined 6% year over year. In the quarter, we saw continued strong market performance in China, up slightly year over year.  North America and European OEMs more than doubled production sequentially, but declined 5% on a year-over-year basis. Diesel sales improved 49% from the second quarter, but we re still down 15% year-over-year. The North American heavy-duty truck market improved, but remains in a cyclical downturn with vehicle production down 46% year-over-year. Third-quarter sales of heavy-duty vehicles in China, however, continue to exceed 2019 levels, and adoption of advanced content increased in preparation for China 6 regulations.  No doubt, this has been a challenging year for our automotive market access platform. However, we are recovering faster than the market due to increasing content, primarily GPS and advanced heavy-duty products. Our content-driven strategy continues to drive strong results. Specialty materials sales were $570 million in the third quarter, up 23% year-over-year and in sharp contrast to the smartphone market, which declined.  Net income grew 59% year over year to $146 million. Sales growth was driven by Ceramic Shield, our new-to-the-world glass ceramic on the iPhone 12 as well as premium glass sales, IT and tablet glass sales in support of work from home trends, and strength in our advanced optic products. In brief, strong adoption and commercialization of our innovations produced strong year-over-year results for the third quarter for specialty materials, and we expect that to be true for full year 2020 as well. In life sciences, North America lab utilization is increasing, and the pandemic is driving demand for laboratory diagnostic test in consumables.  As a result, we are seeing increased demand for our products. In July, we carried out our long-term plan to ramp a new, larger distribution center needed to support our growth and enhance our ability to address our customers  increased needs around the world. Starting up this center in the middle of a pandemic proved to be more difficult than we expected, which constrained third-quarter sales. Sales declined 8% sequentially.  Net income declined 10%, in line with the lower volume. We have added resources where required implemented recovery plans and are confident that operations will support the required output in Q4. As a result, we expect strong sequential life science growth in the fourth quarter. Now, I ll turn to our balance sheet and our dedication to financial stewardship.  As I mentioned at the outset of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger. I ve discussed the operational improvements we ve implemented and our strong free cash flow generation. It is also important to note that we continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a strong cash position that ended the quarter at $2.5 billion. And we have a debt structure that is conservative by design and relatively unique.  Today, our average debt maturity is about 25 years, the longest in the S&P 500. Over the next 15 months, we have under $70 million coming due. Less than half of our total debt is due within the next 20 years. And during this time, there is no single year with debt repayment over $500 million.  Our balance sheet is built for times like these. As I ve previously mentioned, we expect to generate positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the year. We also expect to maintain a strong cash position and to maintain our dividend. We have the financial resources needed for the duration of the economic slowdown.  In closing, we demonstrated outstanding operational performance in the quarter with significant sequential improvement in sales, net income, EPS and free cash flow. We are successfully carrying out the operational and financial goals we set up to stay strong during the crisis. We expect another solid quarter to end the year. We remain aware of potential impacts from the pandemic, the global recession, civil unrest, and geopolitical tensions.  Regardless of how long or what shape the recovery takes, Corning is effectively safeguarding its financial strength, our growth drivers are intact and we continue advancing important growth initiatives with leaders in industries we serve. We are confident that our execution and market leadership positions us to emerge from the current global uncertainty even stronger. With that, let s move to Q&A. Ann?  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Thanks, Tony. OK, Catherine. We re ready for our first question.  Questions & Answers:  Operator  Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is open.  Asiya Merchant -- Citi -- Analyst  Great. Thank you, everyone. Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to ask a question. Wendell, Tony, given the consumer spending has been very strong year-to-date, obviously, we ve seen that in some of the results of our companies.  How do you guys kind of look into the next couple of quarters? Do you feel like visibility is good based on discussions with customers that consumer spending could continue at these levels, you know, as it relates to smartphones, TVs, notebooks, etc., that use up all your products? And then, simultaneously, on the optical side, clearly starting to see some positive trends here. I know it s lumpy, but just as you look at the next couple of quarters, do you feel like you have good visibility at this point into how these quarters unfold. And demand trend continues in the next couple of quarters? Thank you.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Asiya, I think that s an excellent question, and I don t disagree with any of your observations on some of the macro data on both consumer and statements from network operators. That being said, we expect a really solid Quarter 4. And we re just -- and we re off to a really good start this month. But that s really the extent of the guidance that we want to give at this time.  Like last quarter, our business segments, as you just highlighted, continue to flash green. The global uncertainty just reminds us to be very humble in our ability to precisely predict the future and exactly how our customers are going to work their way through this uncertainty. On the opto side, I totally get where you re coming from because we ve all heard from our customers, from the network operators that they re experiencing very strong demand on their network. I mean, there s some great examples.  I mean, they publish this all the time. It s a great website, by the way. The Internet and Television Association reports upstream growth. So, go from your home, up back into the network, that s up 37%.  And also, just recently seen the Microsoft teams set a new single day record of 4.1 billion minutes. Unbelievable, right? And you also hear really strong statements from them that they want to build more capacity to be able to deal with this new baseline of demand that s on. Whether it s AT&T and Verizon or cable TV, companies, or even the public cloud players, they re all quite public that they re planning increases in their capacity. That being said, predicting the exact quarter when these plans turn into deployment at scale, well, that s just challenging.  Just so, once again, I just think we should be very humble in predicting that exact quarter and wait until we see that surge in shipments out of our factories, you know, to claim a rebound in the optical segment.  Asiya Merchant -- Citi -- Analyst  Great. Thank you. And if I may, for Tony, as a follow-up, Tony, given you guys are kind of, you know, managing your capex and inventory levels with very prudently. Should we expect the capex trend that we have been seeing over the last few quarters to sort of continue here? Are we expecting any upsurge in capex at least over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Yes. I think -- I ll say, as we ve talked about before, we have an ongoing amount of capital spending that we expand -- you know, that we spend on kind of expanding our product lines and creating new innovations. But where we really spend a lot of money is when we get into the build cycle, and we re not currently in one of those build cycles, and we don t see ourselves in a build cycle over the next year or so. Of course, we want to eventually get to a build cycle because when we get to a build cycle, that means there s a lot of growth coming, and we always get that with some commitments from customers.  And, you know, we actually saw the benefit of that in the third quarter with our work with Apple. But as we look out over the next several quarters, no, we don t -- we won t be in a build cycle, so we won t see a lot of change from a capex standpoint.  Asiya Merchant -- Citi -- Analyst  Great. Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.  Steven Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst  Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on the optical question. Maybe this is wrong, but my perception is that there wasn t a lot of content growth in the revenues based on what your customers are spending on right now.  Wendell, can you just sort of talk about the outlook for content growth in optical as you eventually, at whatever point it is, see an optical spending surge? Thanks.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  All right. Once again, really good observation, Steve. Most of our operators have been dealing with this year is how do they eliminate some of the bottlenecks in their network, you know, in these challenging times. But while they re being, as you say, you know, quite public on that they re planning to expand their networks.  So, I think the content play is coming, and I believe that it will be quite strong, quite strong, whether it s in cloud because there s been such a huge shift in the cloud during this time, or whether it s in our carriers. Our networks are just trained, and operators don t want to be in a spot where they re running close to red line, and they need to establish that base that is higher. So, I feel really good that it s inevitable, right? But that being said, I call them the quarter, buddy.  Steven Fox -- Fox Advisors -- Analyst  No, I wasn t asking you to. But just to be clear, I know capacity expansion ramp is what would start sort of your content growth coming back. Is that correct? Or am I thinking about it wrong? Thank you.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Yes. I think that is correct. That s when you really see it. You re asking actually a super subtle question, which is we have a sort of more Corning play that s going on here as capacity comes in place more optical.  And then we have particular set of innovations that reduce the cost of deployment pretty significantly in the efficacy of it, and those have a higher revenue content for us. So, in that subtle question that you re asking, we ll begin to see that without an acceleration in capacity growth, but you re not really going to feel it. We re not all going to feel great about it until that -- those technologies get deployed in new capacity expansions.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Your line is open.  Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  Great. Thank you for taking my question. If I can just have a quick clarification. First, right to your comment when -- about light flashing green, I just want to make sure I m reading it right that you re implying all segments are here in a positive backdrop, where they can improve sequentially from 3Q to 4Q, including Life Sciences, for which you re saying 3Q is that trough.  And then in terms of just drilling down a bit on the specialty outperformance that you re seeing, how much of this is driven by content increase versus wider adoption of the cover glass? And if you can drill down a bit on the different areas on a smartphone, you re gaining content?  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Samik, could you -- as a favor to me, could you repeat the second part of that question, I m not sure that I understand it exactly. Could you do that again for me?  Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  Yeah. The question was about specialty outperformance that you re seeing in specialty materials? And how much of the outperformance relative to the underlying smartphone market is content increase versus wider adoption of your cover glass? And which are the areas on a smartphone you re gaining content, if you can just outline that?  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  OK. So, let me start with your second question first. So, the bulk of that growth that you see is content increase. It s basically of beating players adopting our latest innovations that is driving that revenue increase.  So, that is the primary driver, Samik. To your first question, just to be precise on what I mean by flashing green, I said the same thing last quarter. And what I m trying to get at here is not that we re going to have sequential growth, and not that this one particular business is going to continue to do in a certain thing. What I m trying to get at is sort of the dissonance that we feel between the demand that our customers are putting on us and -- versus sort of the uncertainty we see in around the world.  And so, what I m trying to do is give you the insight that we see, which is our businesses are doing well. We ve got a good order book, and we re operating well. That being said, you know, we still exist in the world that we exist in. We just got to be humble about giving exact guidance.  Does that make sense to you, Samik?  Samik Chatterjee -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst  Yes. No. Fair. Sound fair given the current environment.  Thank you.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thank you.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  Yeah, thanks for the question. So, I wanted to start off with Ceramic Shield and just -- well, first of all, congratulations on being named on Apple s stage. I think that was the first. So, congrats on that.  I wanted to, Wendell, just ask you whether that s an exclusive deal. And if it is exclusive, did that -- is there a duration on that? Are there other OEMs you could sell it to eventually? Just kind of how are you thinking about exclusivity versus not on some materials like that? And also, maybe -- I doubt you ll tell me, but I d be interested in the pricing differential with Gorilla. And then I have a second question for Tony. I noticed the inventory days jumped up a little bit in Q3.  Tony, could you give us some maybe color on what drove that increase? Is it related to the smartphone cycle or something else? Thanks.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Start with...  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, why don t I start with the inventory. One, it s a pretty easy answer. You know, during the quarter, we did the Hemlock transaction, and we had to consolidate their balance sheet, which is increase the inventory for Corning, in total. But, of course, that just comes from that transaction itself.  It s a great transaction. We re really excited about Hemlock. Generates a lot of cash. It pays -- we didn t put any money in.  It pays back the debt, you know, within most of it within a year, we have $150 million of ongoing free cash flow generation. So, you know, what we ll make sure is clear, and we can talk about it in our call later today that how much of the inventory came from that versus our own build. If you look at the cash flow statement, we actually lowered our inventory, about $187 million during the quarter. So, our inventories actually came down during the quarter, but it s because of the Hemlock consolidation that you see a little bit different on the balance sheet.  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  OK. Thanks.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  And Rob, to your questions for me. First, your statement. Thank you for the congratulations. We re really proud of that for Ceramic Shield.  It was a lot of work. I have to tell you that it feels, but not quite right to use, Apple s name out loud. I don t think I ve ever done that. Like any size of the company, we have a code name for Apple.  And like, we never even say Apple inside the company. So, like, if you could see me, I sound like turning a little pink, and I m having an anxiety attack that I m using your name out loud. So, if I stumble a little, please be forgiving. So...  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  Really soaking it with Apple s name in the [Inaudible].  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  That s exactly right. So Ceramic Shield, that s Apple s. It s that simple. That s Apple s.  They helped us develop it. They invested in U.S. manufacturing for it. That s theirs.  And it should be theirs. And so that s the way that is. Now, as we take a look at other players, we got a whole stream of innovations for them as well. I think what we re -- what we would love to see, ideal scenario would be that Apple has so raised -- I can t believe I just said Apple again, has so raised the bar on performance for everybody that all of the players will be coming to us to say, we need to have a way to compete with this incredible performance.  And, if that happens, that s just going to all be good for us. We will not do Ceramic Shield for them, but we ve got a lot of great ideas and we ve got a lot of great products to help them raise their game to the new level that was just set. I ve got to revert in Cupertino. So, the next one got to how much that you didn t think I would answer was what s the price delta.  I would say, once again, Rod, you have effectively predicted the future. I am not going to answer that.  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  All right. Thanks. Why wasn t it used on the back of the phone? Too expensive?  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  You have exhausted my ability to get myself to answer any question about that particular company. I just -- I m reverting back to my mode. And very soon, we re going to go back into using code words. So...  Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  OK. All right. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.  Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst  Yes. Thank you. Just to stay on this specialty for a second. On the content increase that you referred to, Wendell, can you talk about whether you meant dollar content, or unit content, or both? And if both, like what the relative split is? And just sort of a little bit technical side of this.  In the -- is the process similar to Gorilla where there s post-processing done by finishers or something different that changes the margin structure of this product? And I have a follow-up on display.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Thanks for the question. So, starting with smartphones, I think the right way to think about it is its content in dollars, right? It s just we re introducing more valuable materials, right? Now, quite often with some of them like [Inaudible] is a great example, is it is a more valuable material that we re introducing, but it also reduces finishing cost for our customers. And so as a result, their part cost can be really close to what they had for Gorilla Glass 6. So that s sort of the shape of the way, but you should think about it as it s brand-new products that have a higher price point is the primary way to think about it from your modeling perspective.  That smartphones. I think you ve also got this going on in laptops in the IT piece is we re also bringing up more content. Once again, the right way to think about this is more value added in our product set rather than increasing a mass of glass or ceramics on the products right now. But super interesting question to when you think about 5G, where you ve seen smartphones evolve to, which is this all-glass structure, pretty much, is driven by, yes, we make awesome product, and like glass is the best thing.  I mean, but other than that, is that they need the RF transparency. And if you pop open a 5G phone, any of them, you will see how much antenna content is in there to be able to handle 5G, and an ability to do 4G, and to be able to do different players depending on where you are in the world. This same thing, I believe, is going to come to the IT products, if there are going to be big 5G users, we re going to have to see more mass of our product or volume of our product on those devices to make them be truly great 5G devices. That answer your question, Wamsi?  Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst  Yes. Yes, it does, Wendell. And if I could follow-up, can you talk about the incremental strength in display? There s some concern in the market that there were some ramp issues in the China glass market that s causing one of your competitors to take some share. Can you comment on that? And maybe just talk about any changes in the pace of Korea ramp down? Thank you.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  So, I think from an overall standpoint, what s really driving the strength in display is what s happening in the end markets, and that s what always, you know, matters from a display standpoint. And as – you know, as we talked about, clearly, TV demand in the COVID world has been pretty strong, but so has IT demand. In particular, notebooks and tablets. And, you know, that s fundamentally what we re seeing there.  And you see it in terms of -- in a couple of ways. One is panel maker utilizations have been high. And I think that has slowed down a bit of the exit of -- from Korea by some of the panel makers there. But, in addition to that, the value chain is pretty tight right now.  So, you know, what is really driving this is in customer demand. And even, from a retail standpoint, as we mentioned, as measured in glass, it s up mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis, and that feels good.  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Next question?  Operator  Our next question comes from Peter Zdebski with Barclays. Your line is open.  Peter Zdebski -- Barclays -- Analyst  Hi. This is Peter, on for Tim Long. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about GPS.  Prior to the pandemic, I think we were looking at a target of about $350 million of sales in 2020. And given that it looks like the auto rebound has been probably a little stronger than expected. Could you give us an idea of how close you might get to that number for  20? And then maybe your thoughts on timing toward that $500 million target?  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  Yeah. You know, I think that, you know, fundamentally, what is driving the sales from a GPS standpoint, of course, is the adoption in Europe and the adoption in China. And, you know, on a year-over-year basis, the European market is down. It rebounded a lot in Q3, but it s still down on a year-over-year basis, but China is actually up.  So, I mean, I think we feel good about where GPS sales are. We certainly feel good that we are outperforming the market because of the content-driven part of GPS.  Peter Zdebski -- Barclays -- Analyst  Thank you, Tony.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.  Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  Great. A couple of questions. On Valor Glass, you know, understanding, you know, the FDA has had a more -- you know, their fast track policy over the last year on vaccines. But just post any vaccines, just progress you think Valor Glass is making within the FDA do not need a drug by drug approval? And then maybe, second, if there were any kind of administration change to come in the next year, just how quickly could emission standard changes flow through the environmental segment? Thanks.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Well, I ll take the first one, and maybe you can take the second. Comment on, if you d like. So, Meta, I think in Valor, we re refueling the broader adoption as well as strategies by our customers to make the regulatory burden be less. I think the way to think about the FDA is they ll react to the plans of our customers, and that will end up providing a basis for how it will evolve in the treatment of Valor Glass.  In general, what I would say is ease of qualification is getting better for us as our customers get more sophisticated in how to do the regulatory moves. You just have to remember, this is the first change, really, in vial packaging in a hundred years. So, everybody was a little out of practice, right? So, we re -- I think with that coming in place, we re getting better. Our real focus though in Valor right now is to support the COVID-19 vaccine efforts.  That s what we re about. And we have focused most of our energy now on supporting various vaccine candidates. And for them, it s a new drug. So, it s -- the new drug is just qualified in our vial because there s no real additional regulatory burden, right? It s the redo that provides an extra burden, not the original.  Our product is superior in every way. From the current product. So that s where we re really focusing our capacity efforts. That s where we re focusing our technology efforts is to use all of Corning s capabilities to make all of us and our children safer, and that s where we re aimed.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  And, Meta, I think in terms of the environmental regulations, you know, the way we look at it isn t as -- at least from our business standpoint and when we will start generating sales, it s not as how quickly the regulations change, it s when the implementations happen. And on environmental regulations, they always take several years to occur. They ve got to change the automotive supply chain and the like. So, while the change in the regulations might be quick in terms of us actually seeing it in sales in North America, that would clearly be a couple of years after that.  Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  Great. Thanks.  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Next question?  Operator  Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- Analyst  Thank you very much. I wanted to add a question. You know, if we look back to April, when you put in place the new operating structure, it was sort of centered around your maps in that. What kind of benefits have you seen from that? How is it working, you know, just given we re, I don t know, five months since it was launched? And then I have a follow-up.  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  So, we basically -- because our innovations have been successful, we ve sort of outgrown our previous structures. And so, we put in place this new operating structure, with Eric Musser as our President and COO, and named New Market Access platform leaders, next-generation leadership, to take each and every one of our major market access platforms. And it s gone great. And my main evidence for that is look at the results.  I mean, it s really strong. So, I ve got nothing but good things to say about that. And I -- and we are all quite hopeful going forward of this type of outstanding operations performance continues.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- Analyst  OK. And then, I don t know, Tony, can you talk a bit about any operational improvements you could make to hemlock now that it s, you know, wholly owned? Just -- or is it where we should just assume it will be stand-alone and there s not much leverage that we had? Thank you.  Tony Tripeny -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  I think there is plenty of operational improvements that we can make there. You know, we obviously, based our -- as we thought about why we re excited about this is based on their current operating performance, those long-term take-or-pay contracts that come with upfront cash payments, the good controls that they have over their costs, both in terms of the assets that they bought from DuPont, but also some, you know, long-term energy contracts that are at very favorable rates. And that s why we re confident in that ability to generate the $150 million of annual cash flow. That being said, we will start working on other kind of operational improvements we can make there.  And a good example of that is that we procure a lot more stuff as a company than they do. And so, I m sure there s opportunities there. I think there s opportunities from a technology standpoint, from a general manufacturing standpoint, market access standpoint, you know, chances to, you know, look at different markets than they ve had before. I mean, they will now get the whole power of the Corning machine to really drive that business.  So, you know, I think on the whole, you know, we would expect improvements over time. Now, how quickly that happen and the like all, we re just at the beginning stages of that. And the fact it s going to have the $150 million a year of free cash flow generation is very exciting.  Shannon Cross -- Cross Research -- Analyst  Thank you.  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Catherine, we ll take one last question.  Operator  Our last question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.  Martin Yang -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst  Hi. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. And my question is about display glass prices.  Is there any opportunity for you to see price improvement even more? I understand that the current structure protects your downside. Just given the tight supply demand right now, is there any way for you to raise price?  Wendell Weeks -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  I would say that, like you d often heard me say, Martin, about display. It s the right way to think about it from an investment standpoint. In my opinion, I have some of my operating folks who believe we can make this be back into a growth machine. But I continue to believe, we should just count on it as aging gracefully, generating tons of cash flow and pricing being moderate, right? And that we just like normally in a maturing business.  That rate of price decline declining. And I think that s the way to think about it. Yeah, and right now, our primary focus is to make sure we bring up those Gen 10.5 plants that we have put in place. And you can remember, that was when we did this, we did this with largely money support from various Chinese players while we kept 100% of the profit stream.  And that move, when we did it, was really a bet on the growth of large-sized TV and a bet on the Chinese LCD manufacturers. That bet is playing out really well. And the key for us is to grow that into its full capability as fast as we can.  Ann Nicholson -- Vice President, Investor Relations  Thanks, Wendell. Great, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Before we close, I wanted to let you know that we ll be at the Baird Virtual Global Industrial Conference on November 10, the Morgan Stanley Virtual Life After COVID Conference on November 11, the Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference on November 30, and the Barclays Global Technology Media and Telecom Conference on December 10.

9,2020-10-27,15:22:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-buys-self-learning-ai-192246478.html,Apple Buys Self-Learning AI Video Company to Improve Apps,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. acquired a startup specializing in advanced artificial intelligence and computer vision technology that may help the iPhone maker improve its own AI across a number of apps and services.
The Cupertino, California-based technology giant acquired Barcelona-based Vilynx Inc. earlier this year, according to people familiar with the deal. Vilynx developed technology that uses AI to analyze a video’s visual, audio and text content to understand what the video shows. It used that technology to create tags for the video, making it searchable.
The deal was completed for about $50 million, said the people who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak about the transaction.
“Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” the company said in a statement.
Vilynx applied its technology to software that companies used for search and recommendation engines for video and other media. On its now defunct website, the startup touted the ability of its system to not only recognize items, but understand them.
“Recognition is detecting Michael Jordan’s face,” the website said. “Understanding is knowing it’s Michael Jordan, the former NBA basketball player who played for the Chicago Bulls and went to the University of North Carolina.”
Apple could potentially apply this technology to the company’s digital assistant, Siri, and its search. It could also be used in the company’s Photos app to make video more searchable in a similar fashion to how users can find photos by searching for items inside the photos. Apple could also potentially apply it toward a recommendation engine for its TV and News apps to surface more relevant content to users.
About 50 of the company’s engineers and data scientists are remaining at Apple, including Vilynx’s co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Elisenda Bou-Balust, the people familiar said.
Apple is keeping Vilynx’s Barcelona office and intends to make it one of the company’s main artificial intelligence research and development centers in Europe, the people said. Apple has started hiring engineers for the office. Apple also has AI engineers in Europe in Cambridge, U.K.; Cork, Ireland; Munich and Zurich.
The deal adds to a growing list of AI companies purchased by Apple in recent years. In 2020, Apple also acquired Xnor.ai, Inductiv and Voysis to bolster its artificial intelligence efforts.
Apple launched Siri in 2011 and has since expanded AI across its software, including the Camera and Photos apps, battery life optimization, and facial and handwriting recognition. But while the company has made strides to improve the machine learning technology, the Siri voice assistant is still regarded as inferior to rivals from Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Amazon.com Inc.
Apple’s recent AI-related deals, an increased public presence for the machine learning group, the hiring of new researchers and the appointment of former Google executive John Giannandrea signal the company’s effort to make major improvements.

10,2020-10-27,14:15:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-t-mobile-is-getting-into-the-tv-business-181538165.html,Here's why T-Mobile is getting into the TV business,"The integration of Sprint and the Apple 5G iPhone rollout be damned — T-Mobile (TMUS) CEO Mike Sievert says his team could continue to maniacally focus on that meshing of cultures and operations and the Apple (AAPL) launch while launching a new attack on Big Cable.
""We are serious,"" Sievert told Yahoo Finance about his fresh effort to challenge pay TV providers. To be sure, the mobile phone operator (at least until now) made a big splash Tuesday by entering the surging streaming content space.
On Nov. 1, T-Mobile will launch nationwide what it calls TVision LIVE. It will feature three different pay and content tiers. The entry level one is called TVision Live TV. It will cost $40 a month for 30-plus channels including ABC, Fox, NBC, Turner and ESPN. Go up to the top tier called TVision Live Zone, you get more than 50 channels (NFL Network, SEC Network, etc.) and NFL Red Zone for $60.
Rounding out the attack plan is the TVision VIBE service (offers live and on-demand programming for $10 a month) and TVision CHANNELS service (a-la-carte streaming offering).
The pricing is well below typical cable TV plans from the likes of Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) that could fetch north of $150 a month. Those sky high cable bills — and the fact people don t watch a majority of the channels they pay for — is what continues to fuel cord-cutting across the U.S.
Well that and because original programming out of Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) is so darn compelling and a monthly subscription is still dirt cheap.
To lure in customers, T-Mobile has joined forces with Apple to offer one free year of Apple TV+. That s provided a person signs up for the premium TVision bundles. Sievert says T-Mobile has no intention of creating its own content a la Netflix or Amazon.
The T-Mobile-Apple partnership is not unlike the one Yahoo Finance s parent Verizon (VZ) and Disney (DIS) have worked on. Verizon has continued to offer Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ to mobile phone subscribers this year who trade up to larger data plans. Last October, Verizon struck first on streaming by offering one free year of Disney+ to 4G LTE and 5G unlimited wireless customers and FiOS internet households.

11,2020-10-27,13:28:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gary-cohn-would-back-bidens-proposed-28-corporate-tax-rate-172828437.html,Ex-Trump adviser Gary Cohn would back Bidens proposed 28% corporate tax rate,"President Donald Trump’s former chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, once helped craft the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that lowered the corporate federal income tax rate (TCJA) from 35% to 21%. Yet he’s comfortable with the rate moving no higher than 28%, a level proposed by Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Cohn told Yahoo Finance’s Adam Shapiro in an interview during Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit on Monday.
The 28% corporate tax rate proposed by Biden would still make the U.S. an attractive place for businesses, according to Cohn, a Democrat who served for a decade as COO for The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. before his time in the White House.
“How do you compete against every other nation in the world? Because international corporations can decide where they’re domiciled ... To me, 28% is probably a good number to land on, to end up being attractive to corporations to be in the United States,” Cohn said.
And it’s not just the tax rate, Cohn added, it s what is being taxed. Under the CARES Act, he said, in order to stimulate the economy, corporate deductions eliminated under Trump’s tax law, such as travel and entertainment, were brought back.
The Trump administration’s tax overhaul has come under criticism given persistent loopholes that allow corporations to drive the effective rate well below the statutory level. In 2018, the work arounds helped a group of 378 consistently profitable Fortune 500 companies to pay an average federal rate of 11.3% on their 2018 income, according to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), a non-partisan think tank.
But Cohn said the overhaul still got rid of many loopholes.
“Let s compare it to what it was prior,” Cohn said of Trump’s tax law. “There were many corporations paying no tax under the prior tax law, as well. We eliminated a lot of the loopholes. I m not going to sit here and say we eliminate all the loopholes. We eliminated many, many of the loopholes.”
The ITEP’s most recent report on corporate tax loopholes may tell a different story. It analyzed the rates paid by profitable Fortune 500 companies during one year under the new rate and eight years under the prior rate. Both resulted in effective rates paid of just more than half the statutory rates.
From 2008 to 2015 when the tax rate was 35%, 258 consistently profitable Fortune 500 corporations paid an effective corporate tax rate of 21.2%, with many prominent companies like General Electric (GE), Priceline.com, and PG&E (PCG) paying no tax at all, according to the ITEP analysis.
In 2018, among 379 profitable corporations in the study the effective federal rate paid was 11.3%, with 91 corporations including Amazon (AMZN), Chevron (CVX), Halliburton (HAL) and IBM (IBM) paying zero federal income tax.
ITEP concluded that loopholes and special breaks rather than the rate itself were responsible for the shortfalls.
“We still have a huge offshoring issue,” Cohn said of loopholes still needing to be closed. “You can create these intellectual property boxes offshore and put your intellectual property in them and then license them back to your U.S. subsidiary. We were doing a lot of work on that. We went as far as we thought we could go and get a tax bill passed.”
Practices known as the “Double Irish” and “Dutch Sandwich” were popularized by Apple (AAPL) and adopted by companies with large intangible assets, predominantly intellectual property, to avoid paying income tax. Google (GOOG)(GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others have used the strategy to push profits to tax havens in Bermuda, for example, through wholly owned subsidiaries in Ireland and The Netherlands. In 2019, Google announced it would no longer implement the tax strategy and going forward would license its IP in the U.S. instead of in Bermuda.
Asked whether a 28% rate was counter to the federal government’s goal of clawing back tax dollars to federal coffers, Cohn said the figure represents one that is the upper limit of what corporations will view as competitive.
“There s a rate where it gets too high, where they don t want to be,” Cohn said. “That 21% to me was the lower end of where we needed to be.”

12,2020-10-27,12:45:00,AAPL,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/27/better-buy-lumentum-vs-texas-instruments/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,Better Buy: Lumentum vs. Texas Instruments,"Lumentum  and Texas Instruments  are both major supply chain players in the tech sector. Lumentum produces optical chips and lasers, and TI sells chips to automotive, industrial, consumer electronics, and communication infrastructure companies.  Both companies have suffered disruptions during the COVID-19 crisis, but their stocks stayed resilient: Over the past 12 months, Lumentum s stock has risen nearly 50% as TI s stock advanced more than 20%. Let s see why Lumentum stayed ahead of TI, and whether or not that trend will continue.  How fast is Lumentum growing?  Lumentum generated 90% of its revenue from its optical communications unit -- which sells optical chips to service providers and data center customers, as well as 3D-sensing chips for advanced cameras -- in fiscal 2020, which ended on June 27. The remaining 10% came from its laser unit, which sells lasers for manufacturing, inspection, and life science purposes.  The optical communication unit s top customer is Apple , which installs Lumentum s optical chips in the iPhone s 3D-sensing cameras. Orders from Apple accounted for 26% of Lumentum s total revenue last year, and that percentage could rise this year with the addition of a LiDAR sensor in the iPhone 12 Pro.  But another major customer is Huawei, which still accounted for 13% of Lumentum s sales last year despite being blacklisted by U.S. regulators. It expects its sales to Huawei to continue declining in fiscal 2021.  Lumentum s total revenue grew 7% to $1.68 billion last year, marking its slowest growth in four years, as a 16% decline in its laser revenue partly offset its 11% growth in optical communications revenue.  The pandemic hurt the laser business, which had already been struggling with weaker demand for fiber lasers, more than the optical business, which offset its slower enterprise optical chip sales with higher 3D-sensing chip sales.  Despite those challenges, Lumentum s adjusted gross and operating margins still expanded in fiscal 2020, thanks to a better product mix and tighter cost controls, and its adjusted earnings grew 28%. Lumentum hasn t offered a full-year forecast for fiscal 2021, but analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 5% and 4%, respectively, before accelerating to double-digit levels in 2022.  How fast is Texas Instruments growing?  Texas Instruments generated 75% of its revenue from analog chips, which include power and signal chain chips, in the first nine months of 2020. Its embedded processing chips, which include connected microcontrollers and processors, generated another 18%.  The remaining 7% came from other types of chips. None of TI s customers accounted for over 10% of its revenue last year.  TI generated 57% of its revenue from the industrial and automotive markets last year, up from 42% in 2013. It believes those two markets will generate long-term tailwinds as factories rely more on automation and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and cars add more chips to their infotainment and driverless systems.  Unfortunately, the pandemic disrupted many industrial companies and shut down major automakers. The company couldn t fully offset that slowdown with stronger sales of chips for personal electronics and healthcare customers, and its total revenue dipped 6% year-over-year to $10.39 billion in the first nine months of the year.  But on the bright side, TI s constant buybacks boosted its EPS 1% even as its gross and operating margins contracted. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to decline 7% and 1%, respectively, before rebounding with single-digit growth rates next year.  TI s near-term prospects seem dimmer than Lumentum s, but investors should keep two things in mind. First, TI s ongoing shift from 200mm to 300mm wafers, which cuts production costs by about 40%, should buoy its gross margins after the pandemic passes.  Second, the company remains committed to returning most of its free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. It s raised its dividend annually for 17 straight years, currently pays a forward yield of 2.7%, and reduced its share count by nearly 50% over the past 16 years. Lumentum doesn t pay a dividend, and it rarely repurchases any shares.  The valuations and verdict  Lumentum trades at just 15 times forward earnings, but TI has a much higher forward P/E ratio of 26. Investors are likely paying a premium for TI because they consider it a good defensive play for a volatile market, but it s a bit pricey relative to its near-term growth.  Lumentum isn t as well-diversified as TI, but it s sitting on multiple catalysts -- including the expansion of the 5G market, the use of LiDARs in driverless cars, and the iPhone 12 -- and trading at a low valuation. Therefore, I firmly believe Lumentum will continue to outperform TI over the next few quarters."

Heres What to Expect.,"Text size  The September quarter may seem like the corporate equivalent of a lame duck for Apple, as the final quarter without any contribution to earnings from the newly unveiled iPhone 12 lineup. Investors are focused on demand for the new phones, but the results may still yield some surprises.    Wall Street is busily tweaking its numbers, resulting in a flurry of Monday research notes, before the figures come out late on Thursday. The consensus forecast is for revenue of $64.2 billion and per-share profits of 71 cents.  Atlantic Equities analyst Ianjit Bhatti on Monday assumed coverage of Apple (ticker: AAPL) from one of his colleagues, lifting the firm’s rating to Overweight from Underweight, and setting a price target of $150. At the heart of his call is the idea that it would be a mistake to value Apple like just another tech company.  “Having created an enduring premium consumer electronics brand, we believe that Apple’s product business should be valued in line with other premium and luxury consumer stocks, rather than traditional computer peers,” Bhatti writes. “Apple’s focus on delivering superior user experiences through design, enabled by its unsurpassed silicon to software design capabilities, has resulted in a premium product positioning, differentiating Apple against computing peers.”  Citi’s Jim Suva sees potential upside to consensus estimates driven by iPads, Macs and Wearables, saying “work from home and stay at home trends continued to drive [an] uptick in consumer tech spending during the quarter.” He sees a promising hint in a recent strong earnings report from the peripherals company Logitech (LOGI), which said that iPad accessories were up 144% in the quarter. Suva maintains a Buy rating on the stock and a target of $125 for the share price.  Meanwhile, Cowen’s Krish Sankar repeats his Outperform rating and $133 price target. He thinks September quarter results will be in line with Street estimates, driven by strong demand for iPads and Macs. For the December quarter, he sees sales up 48% sequentially and 5% year over year, with iPhone unit sales hitting 70 million.  “Apple remains one of out top ideas in the hardware space,” he writes.  Raymond James analyst Chris Caso, who has an Outperform rating on the stock, reports that lead times for the iPhone 12 as of Friday had stretched out to 2-3 weeks in all markets other than the U.S., where the phone was available for same-day or next-day pick up in most parts of the country. He echoes other analysts in finding that the iPhone 12 Pro is in tighter supply than the base iPhone 12, noting that Pro models are not available for in-store pickup in the US at this time.  “This is generally consistent with prior launches, where inventories of the higher-end devices are generally lower than the mass market tier,” he writes.  Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryananai also repeats his Outperform rating and $135 price target, while adding a “tactical outperform” element to his call. He says the stock “should keep working higher,” driven by strong demand for hardware other than iPhones, acceleration in the services business, and strong iPhone 12 demand, driven in part by aggressive promotions offered by wireless carriers in the U.S. Apple’s commentary about the December quarter will be more positive than the Street expects when the company reports results on Thursday, he says.  RBC Capital’s Robert Muller also had a bullish note on Apple on Monday, discussing the results of a survey of more than 800 Apple and Android users on their buying intentions.  “We believe the results bode well for Apple’s newly released 5G enabled phones, which we expect will kick off a multi-year upgrade cycle,” he writes. “iPhone users appear quite sticky with 90% of iPhone customers either ‘definitely’ or ‘likely’ to remain in the ecosystem. This compares to just 71% of Android customers. Further, 24% of Android customers are considering an iPhone for this cycle, with 16% considering a switch to a 5G model. The Apple ecosystem remains strong with the average iPhone user owning 1.9 additional Apple products.”  He kept an Outperform rating and $132 price target on Apple shares.  Apple shares are up nearly 60% this year. The S&P 500 is up 5% in 2020.  Write to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com"

Other Dow winners with a 1% or better gain included Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Procter & Gamble (PG).  Apple, up 1.4%, is trying to reclaim its 50-day line. It s working on the right side of a new cup-with-handle base with a 125.49 buy point. The iPhone maker s stock has rallied nearly 60% through Monday s close.  Microsoft advanced 1% ahead of its earnings after the close. The IBD Leaderboard stock is shaping a new cup with handle, with a 225.31 buy point. It s up more than 30% this year. Analysts expect the software giant to earn $1.53 a share on $35.67 billion in sales. That would mark an 11% increase in EPS and an 8% bump in sales.  AMD, Chegg Pressure The IBD 50  Outside the Dow, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) topped Q3 views with adjusted earnings of 41 cents a share on $2.8 billion revenue. The chipmaker also announced it s buying Xilinx (XLNX) for $35 billion. The all-stock deal is expected to close at the end of 2021. AMD shares fell 3%, while Xilinx soared 10%.  AMD weighed on the IBD 50, as did Chegg (CHGG). Online education stock Chegg plunged 10% in heavy volume despite reporting Q3 results that topped views on both the top and bottom lines. It also offered strong guidance for the rest of this year and next year.  Chegg stock is shaping a cup base with an 89.92 buy point. It may form a handle after today s drop.  But the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) climbed 0.6%, thanks to upside moves from China stocks Futu Holdings (FUTU) and Alibaba (BABA). Software leaders Atlassian (TEAM), Workday (WDAY) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) added about 2% each.

For the quarter, the company posted “core” sales of $3 billion, up 1% from a year ago and 16% sequentially, and a bit above the Street consensus at $2.93 billion. Non-GAAP earnings were 43 cents a share, ahead of the Wall Street analyst consensus at 36 cents.  “Sales and operating income grew on improving demand and commercialization of our innovations,” Corning CEO Wendell Weeks said in a statement. “In all the industries we serve, important market trends are offering new opportunities that we’re uniquely qualified to address.”  Weeks added that while Corning’s markets “continue to flash green,” the company is “keeping a tight focus on cost and manufacturing execution.”  The strongest sector in the quarter was Specialty Materials, where sales were up 23%, driven in part by Apple’s adoption of the company’s new “ceramic shield” display material included in the new iPhone 12, and highlighted in Apple’s recent launch event. The company also noted that Samsung is using the latest version of the company’s Gorilla Glass displays in the Galaxy Note20 Ultra smartphone.  Sales were up 4% year-over-year in display technologies, which mostly supplies television manufacturers. The company said that price declines “were moderate” in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales were down 10% in optical communications, off 5% in environmental technologies, and down 13% in life sciences.  Corning didn’t provide fourth-quarter financial guidance.  Corning shares were down 1.9% to $33.60 in recent trading.  Write to Eric J. Savitz at eric.savitz@barrons.com"
16,2020-10-27,12:02:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/backed-mr-beast-nadeshot-backbone-160202057.html,"Backed by Mr. Beast and Nadeshot, Backbone One could finally crack mobile gaming","I get to play with a lot of new hardware from startups and it runs the gamut from super polished to barely working, neither of which is a value judgement! But every once in a while I get to mess with a new piece of kit that is just so fully realized that I am literally shocked. 
The Backbone One controller is one of those situations. It’s a game controller for iPhones that has slick ergonomics, solid button feel, sensitive analog triggers and great build quality. But what makes Backbone One special is the companion app and service that ships with it and enables a truly clever software layer enabling cross-app multiplayer, game recording, highlight editing and quick swap. 
Designers from Ideo and Astro Studios helped realize Backbone and the pedigree of people who have crafted devices like the Xbox 360 controller really show here. Wide L1/R1 buttons make it easy to tap on mobile. Analog L2/R2 triggers feel deep but tight. The latest Lightning connector standard means extremely low latency for control signals. 
The controller is around 7” long in its compact state and uses a clever sliding mechanism to expand outwards to up to 10” in size. It easily fits Apple’s “Plus” sized phones and when you’re using one of those it feels like a full on game console for the first time I can remember.
There are acoustic tunneling scoops at the inside edges that direct sound forward from the phone speakers and there is work being done behind the scenes to cancel out the specific sounds the Backbone One’s buttons make so that you don’t hear those while you’re playing. 
But it’s the software that makes Backbone One really special.
To co-opt a biblical phrase, hardware without software is dead. And the Backbone One is really, really alive.
Behind the Backbone One is Backbone itself, which is a ‘companion app’ but is really a live gaming service. It has integrated cross-game voice chat, game switching, parties and a friends list. It lets you get push notifications when your friends are on and slide right into a game with them with a single tap. It’s remarkably slick and feels as first-party as you could make something that is literally not first-party feel.
Backbone was founded by Maneet Khaira in the summer of 2018 while interning at YouTube and wrapping up at Columbia. 
Khaira notes that one of the biggest issues in mobile gaming is that there is a ton of activation energy when it comes to jumping in and playing with friends. The major games are there: Call of Duty, Fortnite (eventually, again), PUBG -- but the last mile issue is major. 
Khaira points out that while there are plenty of examples of top-tier gaming titles on iPhone, there is just a desert of content created on these platforms available to watch on Twitch or YouTube. He likens it to a hysteresis -- a lagging behind of an effect from its cause. There are so many mobile gamers that there should be a ton of mobile content shared, but because the mechanisms to do so have been so poor and so under-crafted, we have next to nothing. 
Backbone changes that completely. 
Here are the basic pillars of Backbone:
Gameplay has to feel good. The Backbone controller had to be best-in-class hardware.
Content creation. It had to be easy and seamless to capture highlights, clips and footage and share them to your preferred platform. 
Playing with friends has to be instantaneous. Backbone uses notifications about when friends start playing across any game and you can do so from one central friends list. 
Because Backbone is a support app, it gets a bunch of special privileges that would normally not be granted to a ‘regular’ class of app. Backbone One is always on while it’s attached, which means that the app can do whatever it needs to do no matter what app you’re in or for how long. This is huge because it enables the Backbone button on the controller to add games to your dashboard, swap easily between them and lets you get at your friends list contained in Backbone.
The stopwatch time for attaching the Backbone One to your phone and beginning to play a game in multiplayer is measured in seconds, not minutes. It’s exactly what you need in the mobile context.
[gallery ids=""2066280,2066277,2066262,2066265,2066258,2066259""]
It also enables any-time recording of clips and highlights that store locally on your device but can be uploaded anywhere at 1080p/30fps HEVC. When you’re in game you can just smash the Capture button to start recording and tap it to screenshot. The Backbone app also has some ML work going on to identify highlight-worthy clips and mark them automatically. You can also tag them yourself while you play.
And Backbone One does this on less power than the crap earbuds that (used to) come in an iPhone box. You won’t notice any major power drain from the accessory itself. 
If Backbone can manage to get a partnership with one or two majors to have a built-in control scheme that takes advantage of the proper dead zones and timing it could be a real watershed moment for mobile gaming. 
But right now it works with most games that have controller support right out of the box. No game needs to do anything special to take advantage of the majority of Backbone features. This basically adds on a layer of inter-game social and clip sharing. 
It’s all of the basic features of Game Center, Twitch, PSN and Xbox Live rolled into one -- but on iPhone. And, of course, the BackBone one works just fine with Xbox and PlayStation remote play apps.
Sometimes a list of investors can tell you a lot about how serious a company is about getting the right kind of money. For a company building a gaming service and peripheral hardware, Backbone couldn’t have a more solid column. Backbone is backed by MrBeast, Preston, Kwebbelkop, Typical Gamer, Night Media, Nadeshot, and Ludlow Ventures, as well as Ashton Kutcher and Guy Oseary’s Sound Ventures. Pretty much exactly the profile I would want to see for a company serious about social and mobile gaming. 
In many ways, Backbone feels like a spiritual successor to OpenFeint. If you’re not familiar, OpenFeint was the first modern mobile gaming network. It launched the year after the iPhone App Store and was part of a game called Aurora Feint. It enabled multiplayer, scoreboards and messaging. The founder of OpenFeint? Jason Citron. Jason’s current startup, that also shares a lot of spiritual luggage with OpenFeint? Discord.
It’s hard to overstate how important OpenFeint was at the time. As the app ecosystem was emerging it was clear that games would be a big part of what made the iPhone successful and this was the first cross-game network that allowed people to take advantage of one of the first phones to have a persistent, high-quality (ish) internet connection. Apple launched Game Center as a basic response to this need but it has never put any real investment behind it since. Backbone is so good that I could actually see Apple hauling out the repo and assigning engineering talent to get it working well again. The time has come for this idea and Backbone’s execution is so top notch here that it makes the case open and shut.
I’ve been testing the controller for a few weeks now with a variety of games. I played a quick match of Call of Duty Warzone with Khaira and even though we didn’t secure the dub it was massively more playable than running with touch controls. My very first session of CoD I had a 28 kill game in cod mobile and, even though I was put into a lobby that prioritizes controller users the other players had like 5 kills each. Though you can now pair console controllers to iPhone, the Backbone is so much better than any of the other integrated controllers on the market that it will quickly become a must have for any mobile player that actually wants to be competitive. I have spent as much time with Apple mobile hardware and the people that have created it as probably anyone on the planet so please understand that I don’t say this lightly but this really feels like the game controller and network Apple would have made if it understood competitive games."

Of course, not all shorts have been caught on the wrong side of the technology leaders of this bull run. Plenty have managed to cash in on the struggles of some of the market’s biggest names in 2020.  Topping the list of winners for those who bet on falling stocks, according to S3 Partners data cited by the ValueWalk blog, is oil giant ExxonMobil XOM, -1.58% , which has delivered mark-to-market profits of $1.7 billion so far this year for short sellers. Rising crude inventories and dropping oil prices have been a gift to short-sellers, as the stock has lost more than half its value so far this year. It didn’t help that ExxonMobil lost its status as a Dow component.  Next up, AT&T T, -1.68% , the telecom company which has been bogged down with a hefty debt load, job cuts, asset sales and disappointing numbers for its pay TV platforms. Music to the shorts’ ears, as they’ve enjoyed mark-to-market profits of more than $1.5 billion.  Rounding out the list of the top five best shorts in 2020 are Wells Fargo WFC, -3.87% and Simon Property Group SPG, -4.17% , both delivering more than $1.3 billion in profits for shorts, and Raytheon RTX, -7.03% , which has resulted in a $1.2-billion win."

Big Tech for years has been criticized for choking competition and stifling smaller competitors, and investors are looking for signs that they are extending their lead during the pandemic. However, antitrust storm clouds in recent months have increased.
A scathing report by a House of Representatives panel this month detailing abuses of market power by large tech companies suggests a tough road ahead should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is leading in polls, win the Nov. 3 election.
""There seems to be a lot of angst and desire to not only fine these companies, but potentially change the way they do their business. In the past, there was a lot of lip service, but now you are starting to see some pretty active postures,"" said Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.
Morgan said he expects to see companies set money aside to pay for potential future fines.
Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook have a combined stock market value of $5.5 trillion, compared to the S&P 500 s $29 trillion market capitalization.
Their reports come amid turbulence on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 on Monday posting its biggest daily decline in four weeks, as soaring coronavirus cases and uncertainty about a fiscal relief bill in Washington dim the outlook for an economic recovery.
Microsoft, which posts its results late on Tuesday, has elevated its stock market value by a third in 2020 to $1.6 trillion. Investors expect the software maker to report an 8% rise in quarterly revenue and a 10% jump in net income, with Cowen analyst Derrick Wood saying in a recent client note that Windows sales could get a lift from additional laptop demand as people keep working from home.
S&P 500 technology sector earnings per share are seen rising 0.3% in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
By comparison, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to see an aggregate decline of 16.7% in their third-quarter earnings as the U.S. economy remains crippled by the pandemic.
Amazon s September-quarter report will likely be a ""calm before the storm"" as the online retailer builds more fulfillment centers in anticipation of a busy holiday shopping season, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a client note on Monday.
""With a holiday crunch expected, the scale and pace at which (Amazon) is bringing incremental capacity online is encouraging,"" Shmulik wrote.
Twitter also reports its results on Thursday, with analysts on average expecting a 9% revenue decline as advertisers hurt by the pandemic spend less.
Analysts on average expect Apple s report after the bell on Thursday to reflect a 0.5% drop in revenue to $63.7 billion and net income down 11.2% to $12.1 billion. However, Apple investors are mostly focused on the outlook for sales of the newest iPhone and growth in recurring revenue from apps, games and video and music streaming."

Leveraging a familiar strategy of adding state-of-the-art specs in a repurposed old chassis while charging a mid-range price, sales expectations for the iPhone SE 2 were high as the public health crisis has impacted discretionary incomes. Counterpoint Research initially estimated that Apple would sell 15 million iPhone SE 2 units this year.  New data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) reinforces that optimism.  The midrange iPhone was a hit  The iPhone SE 2 represented approximately 22% of the iPhone mix in the U.S. during the third quarter, according to CIRP. The iPhone 11 lineup accounted for another 64% of sales, which was before the Cupertino tech giant unveiled the iPhone 12 after the end of the quarter. Like many retailers, Apple s retail operations had to quickly adapt to lockdown orders and safety guidelines imposed by governments around the world.  ""In its first full quarter of sales, the $399 iPhone SE accounted for almost one-quarter of iPhone sales,"" CIRP partner and co-founder Josh Lowitz said in a release. ""During a challenging quarter, with COVID-19 altering the retail landscape and delaying launch of new 2020 flagship models, the new SE model succeeded in attracting customers with old phones in need of an upgrade.""  Apple s represented a greater share of total U.S. retail distribution than other channels like big-box electronics stores or wireless carriers. An estimated 21% of iPhone sales were conducted directly through Apple (including both retail stores and online), up from 13% a year ago. Overall, carriers remain the dominant distribution channel for people to buy new smartphones, accounting for 71% of domestic iPhone sales last quarter.  CIRP s estimates were derived from a survey of 500 Apple customers in the U.S. in the third quarter.  Driving Android switchers  The iPhone SE 2 has clearly resonated with consumers, particularly when acknowledging the macroeconomic impacts of the virus outbreak, which were partially mitigated by government stimulus efforts. CEO Tim Cook noted on the last earnings call that the device was appealing to people that prefer smaller phones, while Apple is seeing a higher number of users switch from Android to the iPhone SE 2.  ""We saw marked improvement around the world in May and June, which we attribute to an improved level of customer demand helped by the very successful launch of iPhone SE and economic stimulus packages,"" CFO Luca Maestri added. Cook said that the mid-range iPhone s momentum was continuing into the third quarter.  The mix will inevitably shift aggressively toward the iPhone 12 lineup in the fourth quarter. Apple reports quarterly results on Thursday."
23,2020-10-27,09:59:00,AAPL,https://www.investopedia.com/what-apple-stands-to-lose-from-lawsuit-against-google-5084423?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral,What Apple Stands to Lose From Lawsuit Against Google,"The U.S. Department of Justice filed a milestone antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. s (GOOG) Google last week, which could implicate and negatively affect another Silicon Valley giant: Apple Inc. (AAPL). Recent analysis estimates suggest that the lawsuit could in fact prove more damaging for Apple in the immediate term if the agreement between the two companies is jeopardized.  ""There is a risk, if you play it out, that there actually could be more financial impact to Apple than there is for Google,"" Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst for Bernstein, told The Wall Street Journal in an article published on Oct. 26, estimating that Apple stock could decline as much as 20% if the agreement with Google is dissolved.  The landmark lawsuit, which follows a 16-month investigation by the House of Representatives  judiciary committee, is a part of a broader regulatory push against big tech. However, it remains unclear which of the Silicon Valley companies will prove more vulnerable to mounting regulatory pressure.  The lawsuit highlighted the pact between Apple and Google, an increasing collaboration between the two companies to have Google s search engine as the default choice on Apple products, including the iPhone.  Broadly, the lawsuit accuses Google of abusing monopoly power and ""unlawfully maintaining monopolies through anticompetitive and exclusionary practices"" in search and advertising segments. It specifically mentions Apple in ""long-term agreements with Apple that require Google to be the default – and de facto exclusive – general search engine on Apple s popular Safari browser and other Apple search tools.""  The lawsuit describes that the relationship s evolution from Google being the default search engine on Apple s Safari browser in 2005 in exchange for ad revenue to a broader agreement that included iPhones and later Apple s assistant Siri. ""Today, Google s distribution agreement with Apple gives Google the coveted, preset default position on all significant search access points for Apple computers and mobile devices,"" the Justice Department stated.  The filing cites Google estimates that 50% of its search traffic comes from Apple devices. For Apple, it s clear that the impact would be significant. Google s payments to Apple are projected at $8 billion to $12 billion per year, which make up about 15% to 20% of Apple s global net income.  Google s argument essentially boils down to ""everyone is doing it"" and the idea that it s easy to change your browser setting if you want to. ""Our agreements with Apple and other device makers and carriers are no different from the agreements that many other companies have traditionally used to distribute software,"" said Kent Walker, Google s senior vice president of global affairs, in a blog post titled ""A deeply flawed lawsuit that would do nothing to help consumers."" According to Walker s post, ""Apple s iPhone makes it simple to change your settings and use alternative search engines in Safari – and it s even easier in iOS14 where you can add widgets from different providers or swipe on the home screen to search.""  The investigation from the House antitrust panel earlier this month found that the issue was more with the mobile operating system and broader ecosystem that the consumers became locked into. ""There are significant barriers to switching between the dominant mobile operating systems,"" they found.  There are many uncertainties about how this lawsuit will play out, the outcome of the presidential election, the race for the senate, and the overall regulatory and political climate to hold big tech accountable. For Apple investors, there are also many questions about the sales of the iPhone 12 series, the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries, and retail sales there. Any scaled-down version of Apple s strategic relationship with Google or the potential loss of Google revenue would definitely have a negative impact both in the immediate and longer term.  Whatever the outcome of the lawsuit, it s clear that this is just the beginning. Over the months and years to come, there will be more political and public scrutiny of existing big tech firms, how they do business together, and the impact of these practices on consumers."

Just brace for some surprises as mega-tech firms report their quarterly results.  X  Giant S&P 500 technology and related stocks, like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), are seeing volatility in October. Investors will use what they learn this week from earnings reports to pin their convictions and price targets on tech stocks all year.  Already, S&P 500 tech stock investors are showing their nervousness. The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is down 0.7% in October. That s highly unusual. It means the technology sector is the second worst of the 11 S&P 500 sectors this month. Only the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) is down more in October, at 2.2%. And tech stocks are lagging the S&P 500 s 1.1% gain in the month.  That s a reversal from tech stocks  leadership all year. Tech stocks are up 26.4% this year, easily topping the S&P 500 s 5.5% 2020 gain.  ""Stocks and tech names remain weak as second wave fears and jitters heading into the U.S. elections are creating a bit of a risk-off trade heading into a big week for tech earnings,"" said Dan Ives, tech stock analyst at Wedbush Securities.  Here are some surprises worth looking for in tech stocks:  Microsoft Will Grow Faster Than Apple  Apple is the most valuable S&P 500 company at $1.97 trillion. But analysts think Microsoft will outgrow its tech rival in the third quarter.  Analysts think Microsoft will earn $1.55 a share on revenue of $35.8 billion in the third quarter. If analysts are right, that s 12% quarterly earnings growth on 8.2% revenue growth from the same year-ago period. In fact, over the past month analysts have increased their profit forecasts for Microsoft. Microsoft is expected to report on Oct. 27. Here s what to know if you re thinking about buying Microsoft stock.  That quarterly growth leaves Apple is in the dust. The iPhone maker is seen posting 7.8% lower profit of 70 cents a share on 1.2% less revenue of $63.3 billion. Analysts actually trimmed their Apple earnings target the past month by 0.4%. Apple is expected to report on Oct. 29.  Amazon Will Further Surpass Microsoft In S&P 500 Value  Microsoft is worth $1.6 trillion now, making it the third-most valuable S&P 500 stock after Apple and Amazon. But it will likely get further surpassed by Amazon.com in the next 12 months, analysts say.  Analysts think Amazon has a monster quarter coming up. The online retailer, technically in the consumer discretionary sector, is expected to earn 70% more in the quarter, to $7.20 a share, on 32% higher revenue of $92.5 billion.  And that s a big reason why analysts think the company will be worth $1.88 trillion in 12 months. That s more than 15% above what Amazon is worth now. It s also more than the $1.79 trillion, or 12% more, analysts think Microsoft will be worth in 12 months.  Facebook Is More Resilient Than Many Thought  Social media giant Facebook was supposed to get ravaged by advertiser boycotts and election scrutiny. But investors might be surprised how none of these factors hurt the company much.  Shares of Facebook, technically in the S&P 500 communications services sector, are already holding up better than many of its big tech rivals in October. Facebook stock is up 9.2% in October. That tops the 2.5% gain in Microsoft, 8.3% gain by Apple, 6.5% increase in Alphabet and 1.4% rise in Amazon shares in October.  Even with hundreds of advertisers pulling back on Facebook, analysts think the company s revenue will jump 12% in the third quarter to $19.8 billion. And yes, profit is seen falling 10% in the quarter to $1.91 a share. But Facebook is seen making $23.1 billion in 2020, which is only down roughly 6% from 2019. And profit is expected to jump more than 20% in 2021. Facebook is expected to report on Oct. 29.  ""Facebook s advertising business is proving more resilient than most other digital platforms throughout Covid-19 recession, and with regulatory risks potentially waning a bit, there appears more room for multiple expansion,"" said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.  And that may just be one of many surprises for S&P 500 investors this week.  Vital Stats On S&P 500 Tech And Related Giants  Company Symbol Stock Ch. Oct. % Q3 2020 Rev. % Ch. (est.)

25,2020-10-27,08:00:00,AAPL,https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-buy-now/?src=A00220,Is Apple Stock A Buy Right Now? Here's What Its Stock Chart Shows,"Apple (AAPL) saw its shares jump into record high territory after its June-quarter earnings report. The consumer electronics giant surged to a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. But with a pullback in Apple stock, many investors are wondering if AAPL stock is a buy right now.  X  Apple has been an American success story several times over. First, it ignited the personal computer revolution in the 1970s with the Apple II. Then it reinvented the PC in the 1980s with the Macintosh.  Co-founder Steve Jobs returned to run Apple in 1997 and oversaw a winning streak of innovations that included the iMac, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad and the App Store.  The biggest driver of Apple s modern success is the iPhone. The game-changing smartphone, which debuted in 2007, sparked years of massive growth and created a loyal base of customers willing to buy Apple products and services.  But iPhone sales have slowed as users hold on to their handsets for longer periods between upgrades. However, the company could be on the brink of a major upgrade cycle with its first 5G iPhones.  Apple Stock News: iPhone 12 Debuts  On Oct. 23, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company began selling the 5G-enabled iPhone 12 series. The handsets have display sizes of 5.4, 6.1 and 6.7 inches and starting prices ranging from $699 to $1,099.  In addition to ultrafast 5G wireless connectivity, the 14th-generation iPhones have improved cameras, speedier processors and a new design. The Pro models of the iPhone 12 have a new rear-facing lidar scanner. Lidar, short for ""light detection and ranging,"" will permit depth sensing for photo and video applications, including faster autofocus in lowlight situations. Plus, it will open up new possibilities for augmented-reality experiences.  Apple introduced the iPhone 12 along with the HomePod Mini smart speaker at an online event on Oct. 13. However, investors were unimpressed. Apple stock fell 2.7% the day of the iPhone 12 debut. It was Wall Street s worst reception ever to an iPhone launch.  The next potential catalyst for Apple stock will be the company s September-quarter earnings report, due Oct. 29.  Wall Street expects Apple to earn 71 cents a share on sales of $64.16 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. In the year-earlier period, Apple earned 76 cents a share on sales of $64.04 billion. That would translate to a year-over-year decline of 7% in earnings on flat sales.  Apple Opportunities For Growth  With iPhone growth slowing, investors are wondering what the next big growth driver will be for Apple stock.  Lately, two businesses have given Apple s sales and profits a boost: services and wearables.  In the June quarter, Apple s services revenue rose 15% to $13.16 billion. Services include App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and other offerings.  Meanwhile, Apple s Wearables, Home and Accessories unit saw sales jump 17% to $6.45 billion in the June quarter. This unit includes wearables like the Apple Watch, AirPods wireless earbuds and Beats headphones. It also contains the Apple HomePod wireless speaker and other miscellaneous gadgets.  At a product launch event on Sept. 15, Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Series 6 smartwatches and the lower-cost Apple Watch SE. It also introduced subscription service bundles called Apple One as well as the new Apple Fitness+ service. Still, Apple stock sold off on the news.  Apple Earnings: Beat And No Guidance  On July 30, Apple delivered better-than-expected June-quarter results.  Apple earned $2.58 a share on sales of $59.7 billion in its fiscal third quarter ended June 27. Analysts had predicted earnings of $2.04 a share on sales of $52.25 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Apple earnings rose 18% while sales climbed 11%.  In the June quarter, iPhone sales climbed 2% to $26.42 billion. The company s new lower-cost iPhone SE gave sales a lift in the quarter.  Mac computer sales jumped 22% to $7.08 billion in the June quarter. IPad sales leapt 31% to $6.58 billion. The work-from-home and school-at-home trends driven by the Covid-19 pandemic fueled the gains in both product categories.  Apple did not issue guidance for the September quarter, citing market uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts say Apple might not give December-quarter guidance because of the later-than-usual launch of the new iPhones.  Exclusive Apple Stock Ratings  Since the bounce back from the lows of the coronavirus stock market crash, Apple stock has been outperforming the broader market.  AAPL stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 91 out of 99. That puts it in the top 9% of stocks over the past 12 months.  Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of 99, according to the IBD Stock Checkup tool. IBD s Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings of fundamental and technical performance into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.  In August 2018, Apple became the first company to reach a market value of over $1 trillion. Since it hit that milestone, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have joined it in the trillion-dollar club.  Apple stock was the first to gain a market value of over $1.5 trillion in early June. Amazon and Microsoft have since followed.  On Aug. 19, AAPL stock became the first to reach a market cap of $2 trillion. Longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said Apple stock could reach a $3 trillion market cap sometime this decade.  AAPL Stock Technical Analysis  On April 29, Apple stock broke out of a second-stage cup-with-handle base at a split-adjusted buy point of 72.16, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.  The Dow Jones tech giant later passed a secondary buy point of 80.02 from a cup-with-handle base visible on a weekly MarketSmith chart. IBD Leaderboard analysis provided several additional buy points during its ascent.  On Sept. 2, Apple stock notched a record high of 137.98 on a split-adjusted basis in intraday trading. However, it ended the day down 2.1% amid a sell-off in technology stocks. AAPL stock closed the regular session on Oct. 23 at 115.04.  Is Apple Stock A Buy Right Now?  Apple stock is not a buy right now, but it soon could be. AAPL stock has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 125.49. But in a negative sign, shares are trading below their 50-day moving average line.  The new base is part of a larger, eight-week consolidation with a buy point of 138.08, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.  Keep an eye on the overall stock market, which has been unsettled lately.

Over the weekend, Epic countered in a new court filing and argued that the Mac maker has a monopoly on iOS content distribution, highlighting the key antitrust criticism that regulators and lawmakers have been expressing in recent years.  Here s the latest development in the dispute.  Apple s view is ""misguided""  ""When Epic took steps to allow consumers on iOS devices to make [in-app purchase] payments directly, it breached some of the contractual restrictions that Apple imposes on iOS developers,"" Epic wrote in the latest filing. ""Epic did so because those contractual restrictions are unlawful.""  Epic is referring to the direct payment system that it activated in August, which it knew would trigger swift retaliation from the Cupertino tech giant since Epic was bypassing the App Store and its 30% cut of digital sales. It was a drastic move, as approximately 73 million people play Fortnite exclusively on iOS, which was disclosed in a filing earlier this month. The developer is leveraging the popularity of Fortnite to take a principled stand against Apple, even if that means a large chunk of the player base gets caught in the crossfire.  ""Epic [activated the direct payment system] believing, as it still does, that Apple s contractual restrictions are anticompetitive, denying choice to developers and consumers alike,"" Epic continues. ""Epic did so to show that these restrictions are not a necessary part of the iOS ecosystem; they are just the tools Apple uses to maintain its monopoly.""  Apple often cites privacy and security as primary justifications for its strict App Store guidelines. Epic notes that Apple has not alleged that Epic s direct payment system hurt security and privacy of users in any way, somewhat undermining that rationale.  Epic CEO Tim Sweeney argues that Apple s position is ""misguided.""  What s most disturbing about Apple s position is that they seem to truly believe they ""own"" all commerce involving phones they make, characterizing direct payment as theft, smuggling, and even shoplifting. It s a crazy, misguided view.https://t.co/dAOkE8fW4S — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) October 25, 2020  The digital content that Epic sells within Fortnite is the result of its own creative efforts, and Apple ""has no right to the fruits of Epic s labor,"" the smaller company maintains.  A matter of perspective  Epic is smartly aligning its arguments with broader antitrust concerns. Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee released a report detailing the findings of a lengthy antitrust investigation into major tech corporations. Lawmakers similarly alleged that the App Store represents an illegal monopoly, but Apple defended itself by arguing that the App Store represents a small part of the overall market for all software distribution. It s a matter of perspective.  Epic says that if it fails to prove its antitrust claims when the case goes to trial next summer, it will ""be responsible for any sums owed to Apple."""
27,2020-10-27,07:45:00,AAPL,https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/27/better-buy-nvidia-vs-qualcomm/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article,Better Buy: NVIDIA vs. Qualcomm,"NVIDIA  and Qualcomm  are established tech giants positioning themselves for prosperity in the new economy. Both appear to have successfully redefined themselves to do well in today s tech industry.  However, investors should not assume that these two companies are going to thrive equally. Both companies compete in separate parts of the tech industry and contend with differing competitive conditions.  Let s take a closer look at both NVIDIA and Qualcomm to see which might make a more lucrative investment given the competitive environment each operates in.  The opportunities ahead  Despite each being generally designated as semiconductor stocks, the two companies have little in common. NVIDIA drew its picture of success by manufacturing graphics processing units (GPUs), while Qualcomm excels by specializing in chips for smartphones.  NVIDIA has come a long way from the days when it provided GPUs primarily to enhance gaming capabilities in PCs. The company has since applied its strengths to provide chips for artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), and other applications. Thanks to the ray-tracing technology NVIDIA introduced in 2018, it has become a leader in numerous areas such as supercomputing, robotics, and self-driving cars.  However, it has also attracted a formidable competitor in Advanced Micro Devices . AMD formed a Radeon Technologies Group division in 2015. In time, AMD s new division helped it begin to gain market share. NVIDIA has managed to fight back, and it should remain the market leader for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, NVIDIA will face continuous competitive pressures in this market.  This is not the case with Qualcomm, which connects with customers and investors through its smartphone chipsets. This has made manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung dependent on its technology. It has also attracted lawsuits from Apple and antitrust suits from the government.  With the onset of 5G networking, conditions have turned in Qualcomm s favor. The company got the ruling that it was a ""monopoly"" overturned, paving the way for 5G phone sales. Moreover, Apple settled its lawsuits with Qualcomm, though it also bought Intel s smartphone chipset business. This means Qualcomm could face competition in the future.  The stocks compared  During 2020, NVIDIA has delivered a stronger performance by far between the two companies. Their stock prices paralleled each other at the beginning of the year, but NVIDIA s stock price has experienced significantly higher growth than Qualcomm since February.  However, NVIDIA investors must also pay a higher premium to buy the stock. At a forward P/E ratio of more than 50, its stock price comes in far ahead of the 21 forward multiple of Qualcomm.  In fairness, new NVIDIA investors will buy a great deal of growth. Analysts project earnings will grow by 57% this year. Also, in the most recent quarter, non-GAAP earnings increased by 76% from year-ago levels.  Still, reaction to COVID-19 and the demands it created may have driven much of that growth as millions found themselves needing to work from home. The pandemic will run its course at some point. Consequently, analysts project NVIDIA s earnings growth will be reduced to 21% year over year in the upcoming fiscal year.  The story is different for Qualcomm, as non-GAAP earnings rose by 8% from year-ago levels in its most recent quarter. This is similar to forecasts for the current year, as analysts predict an 11% year-over-year profit increase.  Nonetheless, with the release of the 5G iPhone from Apple, Qualcomm appears positioned to benefit from a multiyear upgrade cycle. For next year, projections point to a 65% increase in net income. Moreover, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate for smartphone chipsets of 63% through 2027. This indicates Qualcomm s massive growth can continue for a long time to come.  NVIDIA or Qualcomm?  NVIDIA stock has recently outperformed Qualcomm and should deliver outsized returns for years to come. However, investors have to look to the future. With the massive profit increases that will probably come from the 5G upgrade cycle, Qualcomm is the stock more likely to deliver higher returns going forward.  The uptrend should continue for several years as smartphone users upgrade to 5G. Additionally, prospective shareholders who buy now can acquire Qualcomm stock at a significant discount to NVIDIA s current valuation.  Investors should profit regardless of which stock they choose. Nonetheless, Qualcomm s low cost and 5G market dominance is a value proposition with too much potential to ignore."

But a stock split doesn t increase your earnings; It gives you more shares in your account while keeping the total value of the stocks in your account the same. The shares are just listed at a cheaper price, making the company stock more affordable to a broader range of investors.  For example, let s say you owned one share of stock that was worth $400 before the split. After a 4-for-1 stock split, you now own 4 shares of stock that are valued at $100 per share for a total value of $400. As you can see, the value didn t change -- your stocks are still worth $400. Your original piece of the pie was just split into four different slices.  Kiss your tax anxieties goodbye  So, relax. Stock splits are one move in the markets that won t give you a headache during tax time. Unlike selling a stock or earning dividends, a stock split does not increase your income in itself. You may have received additional shares in your account, but you didn t receive additional money in your hands as a result of the stock split.  A stock split has nothing to do with your tax returns because it is not a taxable event. Any time you receive unexpected ""gifts"" from major companies, you always have to consider how it will impact your taxes. A stock split is a different type of gift -- it s a gift that adds more shares to your account without you having to do anything in return!  What happens if you sell shares of stock after a stock split?  A stock split gives you the ""enjoy your life and forget about taxes"" pass -- no action required on your behalf when a stock split occurs. But if you get too antsy and decide to sell shares of stock after a split, there are taxes to pay. The IRS requires you to pay either short-term or long-term capital gains taxes on any profits you receive in the stock market.  Let s say you held your investment in Apple for a year or less (short-term), you will pay the same rate of taxes that you pay on your income from working a job. But you can enjoy a better deal on taxes if you held your investment for over a year (long-term). See the special tax rates for 2020 long-term capital gains below.  For single filers with taxable income of... For married joint filers with taxable income of... For heads of households with taxable income of... ...this is the long-term capital gains rate $0 to $40,000 $0 to $80,000 $0 to $53,600 0% $40,000 to $441,450 $80,000 to $496,600 $53,600 to $469,050 15% Over $441,550 Over $496,600 Over $469,050 20%  DATA SOURCE: IRS.  Earning profits from selling shares of stock comes with more paperwork during tax time -- add Form 8949-Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets to your ""to-do"" list. Don t panic -- your brokerage firm does most of the hard work for you. You ll receive a Form 1099-B during tax time to help you report your cost basis -- the price you paid for the stock -- as well as short- and long-term capital gains.  But, if you haven t touched your stocks since Apple s stock split in August, you can keep investing and focusing on the long term so you can enjoy those favorable tax benefits!"

Though many tech companies will be releasing their latest quarterly results this week, three definitely worth watching are tech giants Amazon  Facebook , Apple . All three of these companies are slated to report quarterly results after market close on Thursday.  Ahead of their earnings reports, here s a quick preview of some items related to each company that will be worth checking on.  Amazon: Did revenue soar again?  E-commerce and cloud-computing giant Amazon absolutely obliterated analyst estimates when it reported second-quarter results in July. Net sales soared 40% year over year to an all-time record of $88.9 billion. Net income jumped from $2.6 billion in the year-ago quarter to $5.2 billion. The ongoing adoption of e-commerce was accelerated during the quarter as consumers sheltered at home.  While investors are planning for a deceleration in Amazon s revenue growth rate in Q3, they are still expecting impressive growth. On average, analysts forecast third-quarter revenue to rise about 32% year over year.  Investors should also look to Amazon s guidance for the important holiday quarter. On average, the consensus analyst forecast for the period currently calls for 27% year-over-year growth.  Apple: Can services keep up its momentum?  Tech giant Apple surprised investors when it reported double-digit revenue growth and growth in every single product segment and geography in its last quarter. The strong business performance highlighted the resiliency of Apple s business model during trying times. Did Apple keep up this momentum in fiscal Q3?  Analysts were shooting in the dark when it came to estimating Apple s revenue growth for its just-ended fiscal fourth quarter, as management didn t provide any guidance. On average, analysts are expecting revenue for the period to be about flat compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, earnings per share is expected to decline about 7%.  Investors should check in on Apple s services business. As the company s second-largest segment, the lucrative segment is becoming increasingly important to a long-term thesis for Apple stock. Did the service business keep up a similar growth rate as it achieved in fiscal Q3, its revenue increased 15% year over year?  Facebook: A critical look at advertising spend trends  Facebook s third-quarter report will be particularly interesting since it will help investors get a good look at how global advertising spend is faring during these uncertain times. In Q2, Facebook s year-over-year advertising revenue growth rate slowed to 10% -- down from 17% in the first quarter of 2020.  Analysts are largely expecting another quarter of slower growth compared to before the coronavirus. On average, analysts are modeling for the tech company s advertising revenue to grow about 12% year over year in Q3.  Just as is the case with Amazon, investors should look for any insight into management s expectations for the important holiday quarter. Advertising spend typically jumps sharply sequentially in Q4. But there s a lot of uncertainty surrounding how 2020 s holiday season could play out."
31,2020-10-27,06:04:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-earnings-approach-under-100408326.html,Big Tech earnings approach under antitrust cloud,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Apple <AAPL.O>, Alphabet <GOOGL.O>, Amazon <AMZN.O> and Facebook <FB.O>, together accounting for about a fifth of the S&P 500 s total value, report their quarterly results on Thursday, with their stocks trading near record highs, even as they face increasing antitrust scrutiny.
Amazon and Apple have surged 74% and 57%, respectively, this year, far outperforming the S&P 500 s 5% gain as the coronavirus pandemic accelerates trends toward online shopping, video streaming and other technologies helping Wall Street s largest companies take market share from smaller rivals.
Big Tech for years has been criticized for choking competition and stifling smaller competitors, and investors are looking for signs that they are extending their lead during the pandemic. However, antitrust storm clouds in recent months have increased.
A scathing report by a House of Representatives panel this month detailing abuses of market power by large tech companies suggests a tough road ahead should Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is leading in polls, win the Nov. 3 election.
""There seems to be a lot of angst and desire to not only fine these companies, but potentially change the way they do their business. In the past, there was a lot of lip service, but now you are starting to see some pretty active postures,"" said Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust.
Morgan said he expects to see companies set money aside to pay for potential future fines.
Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook have a combined stock market value of $5.5 trillion, compared to the S&P 500 s $29 trillion market capitalization.
Their reports come amid turbulence on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 <.SPX> on Monday posting its biggest daily decline in four weeks, as soaring coronavirus cases and uncertainty about a fiscal relief bill in Washington dim the outlook for an economic recovery.
Microsoft <MSFT.O>, which posts its results late on Tuesday, has elevated its stock market value by a third in 2020 to $1.6 trillion. Investors expect the software maker to report an 8% rise in quarterly revenue and a 10% jump in net income, with Cowen analyst Derrick Wood saying in a recent client note that Windows sales could get a lift from additional laptop demand as people keep working from home.
S&P 500 technology sector earnings per share are seen rising 0.3% in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
By comparison, analysts expect S&P 500 companies to see an aggregate decline of 16.7% in their third-quarter earnings as the U.S. economy remains crippled by the pandemic.
Amazon s September-quarter report will likely be a ""calm before the storm"" as the online retailer builds more fulfillment centers in anticipation of a busy holiday shopping season, Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik wrote in a client note on Monday.
""With a holiday crunch expected, the scale and pace at which (Amazon) is bringing incremental capacity online is encouraging,"" Shmulik wrote.
Twitter also reports its results on Thursday, with analysts on average expecting a 9% revenue decline as advertisers hurt by the pandemic spend less.
Analysts on average expect Apple s report after the bell on Thursday to reflect a 0.5% drop in revenue to $63.7 billion and net income down 11.2% to $12.1 billion. However, Apple investors are mostly focused on the outlook for sales of the newest iPhone and growth in recurring revenue from apps, games and video and music streaming."
32,2020-10-27,03:55:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-developing-smaller-airpods-pro-100000090.html,"Apple Plans Smaller AirPods Pro, Revamped Entry-Level Model","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is planning updates to its AirPods earbuds next year, seeking to capitalize on the success of a product that has become an important source of growth.
The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on two new models: third-generation entry-level AirPods and the second version of the AirPods Pro earbuds, according to people familiar with the plans.
The models will join other new Apple audio devices like the HomePod mini and upcoming over-ear headphones. The company has also weighed launching another smart speaker that would sit between the HomePod mini and the original version in the line up.
The design of the updated entry-level AirPods will be similar to the current AirPods Pro, gaining a shorter stem and replaceable ear tips. Apple is also looking to improve battery life. That model however will not have higher-end AirPods Pro features like noise-cancellation, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.
For the new AirPods Pro, Apple is aiming to make the earbuds more compact by eliminating the short stem that currently sticks out from the bottom. A design in testing has a more rounded shape that fills more of a user’s a ear -- similar to the latest designs from Samsung Electronics Co., Amazon.com Inc. and Google.
Integrating noise-cancellation, wireless antennas and microphones into a smaller AirPods Pro casing has proved challenging during development, which could result in a less ambitious design when the product is finalized, the people said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.
Apple has internally discussed launching the new low-end AirPods during the first half of next year. The company is also planning new wireless chips to power both models. Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Goertek Inc. are expected to handle most of the production for the new earbuds.
Goertek, which derives roughly 40% of its revenue from Apple, jumped 2.5% to a record in Shenzhen trading Tuesday. Luxshare inched up 0.2%, after having more than doubled this year.
After being mocked by some early on, AirPods have become one of Apple’s biggest hits in recent years. The company’s Wearables, Home and Accessories division, which includes AirPods, reported $6.5 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, up more than 70% from two years ago. The earbuds may get a new sales boost soon because Apple stopped including headphones with new iPhones.
The success has attracted rivals such as China’s Xiaomi Corp. that offer more affordable options.

Apple currently sells entry-level AirPods for $159 and the AirPods Pro at $249. The original AirPods launched in 2016 and were last updated in March 2019. The AirPods Pro came out in October last year.
Beyond the new AirPods, Apple has also internally weighed a new HomePod that sits in size, price and sound quality between the original $299 HomePod and the $99 HomePod mini. It’s unclear if Apple will ultimately launch that product or just further cut the price of the higher-end version.
Apple is still planning to announce high-end, noise-canceling over-ear headphones. The device has faced several development challenges over the past two years and has been delayed multiple times.
The headphones were due to go into production weeks ago, but that was pushed back due to problems with the headband, a person familiar with the matter said. That part was deemed too tight in some testing.

The company initially wanted to include large touch pads on the sides of the headphones, but reduced the size of those panels. Apple has also scaled back some of the interchangeable functionality of the headphones that were a hallmark of the initial concept. The latest version of the product is likely to lack a replaceable headband, but could still include interchangeable ear pads.

33,2020-10-27,00:30:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-succession-plans-complicated-lee-043031609.html,Samsung Succession Plans Complicated by Lees Risk of Jail Time,"(Bloomberg) -- Jay Y. Lee has been groomed for decades to take over Samsung Group, the conglomerate founded by his grandfather and built by his father into a technology giant. Yet even after the death of Lee Kun-hee on Sunday, his only son will likely have to wait a bit longer for his ascension.
The younger Lee is in the midst of two trials over allegations he used bribery and accounting trickery to smooth his succession. While he has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, Lee faces the possibility of returning to jail if he is convicted. Samsung may hold off on naming Lee to his father’s role as chairman of Samsung Electronics Co. at least until the first trial is completed in the coming months, avoiding a scenario where the newly minted chairman goes to prison.
That means Samsung would operate without a chairman for at least a few more months, a lack of clear leadership that could hurt many companies. But Samsung Electronics has respected executives who run the key operations, and Lee already holds the title of vice chairman to make broader, strategic decisions as needed.
“I think Jay Y. Lee will be promoted to chairman early next year,” said Lee Sang-hun, analyst at HI Investment & Securities. “He might also wait until the bribery case is finalized.”
Samsung declined to comment. The company hasn’t said who will take over the chairman position or when.
The timing of Lee’s formal ascension is sensitive given how public dissatisfaction with the country’s powerful conglomerates, or chaebols, has grown in past years. That backlash stems in part from the high-profile allegations of graft against Lee, which triggered the impeachment of then-President Park Geun-hye.
Also complicating the succession is an enormous inheritance tax bill the Lee family will have to pay, possibly loosening their control over the conglomerate. The elder Lee had an estimated fortune of $20.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and could owe about $10 billion because of the country’s high rates.
Samsung Heirs Owe Billions in Taxes. Here’s How They Might Pay
Most families choose to pay such taxes in cash rather than in stock to maintain control, said Chung Sun-sup, chief executive officer of Seoul-based corporate-analysis firm Chaebul.com. They can take five years to make the payments, he said.
There’s little doubt the 52-year-old Lee will succeed his father eventually. The younger Lee, who is trilingual, studied at Japan’s Keio University and Harvard Business School after receiving an undergraduate degree from Seoul National University, the nation’s top school. He has brought a more global approach to Samsung’s management, forging relationships with key partners like the late Steve Jobs.
While Samsung Electronics is best known globally for its smartphones and appliances, it makes most of its money by supplying companies like Apple Inc. with components such as memory chips and panels.
Chang Sea-Jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore Business School, said the alternatives to simply promoting Lee may be worse. Naming an interim chairman from the Samsung executive ranks, for example, would complicate decision making by adding an extra management layer, he said. There would be valuable clarity in Lee taking on his father’s role, he said.
“I think he should take the chairmanship now,” said Chang. “Whatever the circumstances, he has to make the decisions.”
Samsung can’t afford to drift. The company faces renewed challenges from Apple and the rise of tough Chinese competitors in smartphones, along with chronic pricing difficulties in memory chips. Samsung is also embarking on expensive initiatives in fifth-generation wireless technology and the semiconductor foundry industry. Samsung Electronics reports results Thursday.
Samsung Low-Profile Heir Poised to Succeed Father Seen as a God
Chang pointed out that Lee wouldn’t have to run individual business units because of the professional managers who steer the operations. That’s a marked contrast to the early days of his father’s tenure, when the elder Lee got deeply involved in key divisions.
“He doesn’t have to be another Lee Kun-hee; they have much stronger professional management,” Chang said. “He should be a different kind of chairman than his father.”
Lee’s legal troubles could drag on for years. A retrial of bribery and corruption allegations will unfold this year, with a decision likely early next year. A newer case about alleged accounting wrongdoing will get under way again in January and will likely take months.
Such prosecutions don’t carry the same kind of stigma in South Korea as they do in many other countries. Lee Kun-hee was convicted twice -- and pardoned twice. The chairman of SK Group was also jailed in 2013, then returned to his company in 2016 where he remains at the helm.
Chang joked that prison is almost like “graduate school” for the country’s business leaders.
“Eventually we should move away from this environment in South Korea and have the same standards as other countries,” he said.

34,2020-10-26,22:24:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/halt-wechat-ban-stays-place-224835601.html,Tencent Surges After U.S. Court Upholds Stay on WeChat Ban,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration lost a bid to enforce its prohibitions against the Chinese-owned “super app” WeChat in the U.S. after appealing a judge’s ruling that the ban probably violates the free-speech rights of its users.
Upholding a trial judge, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Monday rejected the administration’s request for a stay of the preliminary injunction that prevents the administration from enforcing a wide range of measures, including barring the app from Apple and Google’s app stores for U.S. downloads, over purported national security concerns. Shares of WeChat owner Tencent Holdings Ltd. jumped as much as 3.1%, the most in two weeks, on Tuesday to an intraday record in Hong Kong trading.
The Trump administration has claimed that WeChat is a threat because Tencent is intertwined with the Chinese Communist Party, which can use the app to disseminate propaganda, track users, and steal their private and proprietary data. It’s a similar argument that the administration has used to target the TikTok app, owned by ByteDance Ltd., while also forcing a sale of that app’s U.S. operations.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction on Sept. 19 -- the day before the ban was to go into effect -- at the request of a group of U.S. WeChat users. They argued the prohibitions would violate the free-speech rights of millions of Chinese-speaking Americans who rely on it. The app has 19 million regular users in the U.S. and 1 billion worldwide.
In Monday’s order, a three-judge panel said the administration hasn’t shown it will suffer “an imminent, irreparable injury” while the litigation plays out.
Even as Tencent gets a reprieve from the broader WeChat ban, the company may still face restrictions against the app’s payments services. U.S. officials have stepped up behind-the scenes talks about measures against WeChat Pay and Ant Group’s Alipay, people with knowledge of matter said earlier this month.
The case is U.S. WeChat Users Alliance v. Trump, 20-16908, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco).

The fund takes a conservative approach to its investments, including using hedging and risk management strategies to achieve its desired risk-adjusted returns. The fund’s assets under management more than doubled between early-2017 and early-2018, and topped $542 million in the middle of 2020.
The surge in AUM is somewhat surprising given the Brasada Long-Short Equity Fund’s lukewarm returns. 2019 was one of the fund’s better years, as returns hit 12.99%. The preceding four years were a lost cause, with losses in 2018 and 2015 slightly outpacing the single-digit gains posted in 2016 and 2017. Overall, the fund’s compound annual return was 1.92% through the first quarter of 2020.
Let’s check out some of the biggest moves made by Brasada Capital Management in Q2, which included taking much bigger stakes in Danaher Corporation  and Apple Inc. .
Frank Gaertner / Shutterstock.com
Hedge funds have never been more bullish on Danaher Corporation , with ownership of the stock rising by over 50% in the last 18 months among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Brasada made a much bigger commitment to the stock during Q2, more than tripling the amount of DHR shares it owns. Danaher shares are having an impressive 2020, gaining over 50% for the second-straight year on the strength of strong results like double-digit revenue growth in Q3.

Brasada Capital also added to its Apple Inc.  position, hiking it by 43% to nearly 15,000 shares. Apple is now several years removed from being hedge funds’ favorite stock, though it did rank among the 11 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About in 2020 Q2 and ownership of the tech giant has risen by over 20% in the last year among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Preorders for Apple’s iPhone 12 have been very strong despite the line’s aggressive pricing, more than doubling what the iPhone 11 models generated. With Apple’s shares up by over 50% in 2020, it will need to deliver stellar results like that for the stock to avoid a holiday slump.
Brasada Capital more than doubled the size of its Prologis Inc  position in Q2, taking a much bigger stake in the industrial REIT and supply chain logistics company, which manages the flow of more than $2 trillion in goods annually. Brasada Capital isn’t the only hedge fund to have a growing interest in PLD, as ownership of the stock among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey has jumped by 40% over the past year, during which time Prologis has continued to boost income at a strong rate while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet.
Amazon.com, Inc.  was another tech giant that Brasada Capital bought more shares of during Q2, boosting the size of its Amazon holding by 82%. Amazon is far and away the most popular stock among hedge funds, with 30.1% of the funds tracked by Insider Monkey being Amazon shareholders. Amazon’s annual Prime Day event, which was pushed back from July until October this year due to the pandemic, shattered sales records, pulling in $3.5 billion during the two-day event, a 60% year-over-year increase (see 25 best things to buy on Amazon under $20).
Brasada Capital opened a new position in WEC Energy Group, Inc.  during the second quarter, one of many funds to buy into the stock in 2020, as ownership of it doubled during the first-half of the year among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment are among the prominent funds to buy WEC this year.

The three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a brief order the government had not demonstrated it would ""suffer an imminent, irreparable injury during the pendency of this appeal, which is being expedited.""
On Friday, a U.S. judge in San Francisco rejected a Justice Department request to reverse her decision preventing the WeChat ban."

(NASDAQ: AAPL) is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday afternoon. The company is unlikely to announce its September-quarter results ahead of estimates, given the delayed iPhone 12 launch, according to BofA Securities.
The Apple Analyst: Wamsi Mohan maintained a Neutral rating for Apple with a price target of $140.
The Apple Thesis: The later launch of the iPhone 12 creates twin headwinds for the company – one in terms of lower units of the new phone and lower ASPs (average selling prices) due to the mix having more units of the older models, Mohan said.

He expects iPhone revenues to have declined by 25% year-on-year and by 5% sequentially in the quarter and for overall revenues and earnings to come in at $62.1 billion and 63 cents per share, respectively, short of the consensus estimates of $63.8 billion and 70 cents per share.
“We model services growth of 13% y/y for Sep quarter but given the strength in the app store, there could be modestly higher growth in the qtr (~14-15%), especially if licensing trends (Google rev share) drives a reacceleration,” the analyst wrote in a note. “While weaker Sep qtr results might be less consequential, it remains unclear if Apple will guide the Dec qtr with a wider range or not at all.""
AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple closed Monday at $115.05.

Why BofA Is Upgrading Sonos Ahead Of Smart Speaker Stock s Q4 Report"
38,2020-10-26,18:13:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ll-cool-j-started-a-business-during-covid-19-his-3-biggest-tips-for-you-221337247.html,LL COOL J started a business during COVID-19  his 3 biggest tips for you,"LL COOL J says the hip-hop industry has put too much attention on catering to millennials and forgot about the Gen X crowd that birthed them and some of the most classic tracks ever.
“I think that Generation X has been completely ignored and written off. I mean, they re a group that built hip hop. They re a generation that is rooted in the culture. They are a generation that really lives in and speaks it. They ll pay for elevated experiences,” LL COOL J explained at this year’s Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit. I think that they are just a group that really loves and enjoys classic hip-hop. And no one has really saw the value in that. And they ve just been asleep.”
The music icon’s remedy? Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, he launched an Amazon-like marketplace that focuses on classic hip-hop and the Gen Xers who could appreciate it (and who have the money to spend to show that appreciation).
Dubbed Rock The Bells (the name pays homage to one of his biggest hits, “Rock The Bells”), it features written and video content from the legends of hip-hop such as Big Daddy Kane, Run DMC, Eric B, Salt-N-Pepa, Fab 5 Freddy, Risk, Crazy Legs, Roxanne Shanté and Jonathan Mannion. The site includes a carefully curated marketplace — segmented into jerseys, footwear, Black-owned businesses, and jackets — dedicated to buying classic hip-hop era merchandise. Want to look like LL in a trademark Kangol bowl hat? Plunk down $68 and the orange hat and the LL look is yours to splash all over Instagram.
LL COOL J concedes he did get a bit lucky on the launch.
For one, hip-hop has a loyal following. Two, the website is an extension of the Rock The Bells station on SiriusXM that LL COOL J launched in 2018. So, people do know the brand and of course, know LL.
And being LL COOL J does offer up access to heavy-hitters. Glenn Hutchin’s (co-founder of Silver Lake Partners and AT&T board member) North Island is on the Rock The Bells board. And so is Mark Cuban’s Radical Investments and Apple senior vice president of internet software and services Eddy Cue.
That said, the artist says he applied some key business principles that he has used for years in the business’ launch. He thinks other aspiring business owners could apply these same principles with success, especially if they are eyeing a startup during tough times like the pandemic.
“Well you ve got to have faith. And you got to go with your gut. I think gut instincts are an important tool in your toolbox. You know, using your intuition, using your instincts. And if something is gnawing at you, don t ignore that voice inside of you. Don t ignore that small, still voice,” says LL COOL J. “You have to do something that you re not only passionate about, and that you can be the best at, but then you have to have the people around you that have the skill set to operationalize what it is you re trying to do. You know, Rock the Bells is not just about LL COOL J and my knowledge of classic hip hop. I ve put people in positions who really understand the fundamentals of how to take this business from A to Z. And that s what it s about. And then, you know, the chips are gonna fall where they may.”

39,2020-10-26,18:00:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5g-much-better-not-due-220017381.html,"Your 5G Is About to Get Much Better, and Not Due to the New iPhone","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. has finally joined the 5G party, and it’s a well-timed entrance.
Often derided for being late to new technologies, and rightly so, the launch of its first 5G iPhones coincides with some important changes to be rolled out by the telecoms industry this quarter. As a result, wireless connections are going to get better and smartphone performance should improve.
Release 16 of the 3GPP standards, also known as 5G Phase 2, is mostly focused on technologies that will benefit non-smartphone applications, including vehicle communications, factory connectivity and internet of things. (Release 15 marked the first set of 5th-generation mobile telecom specifications). The details were finalized in June — frozen, in industry parlance — and will be rolled out by year end. While the standards are global, countries, operators and vendors may implement them at different times.
Yet owners of Apple’s $999 iPhone 12 Pro along with consumers who have the Galaxy S20 5G from Samsung Electronics Inc. ($999) or the Mate 40Pro from Huawei Technologies Co. ($1,400)(1) can also expect to see some upside.
And it’s not a minute too soon. As my colleague Tae Kim pointed out recently, the lackluster current state of 5G networks “could lead to underwhelming demand.”
One of the biggest complaints about 5G handsets is that they’re power hogs, a fact acknowledged by Samsung. An update contained in Release 16 addresses this by offering a power-saving technique called DRX adaptation. DRX stands for discontinuous reception and has been used in 4G systems, with the new specifications now making a version available for 5G radio standards. This feature allows the smartphone and the network to coordinate so that the device can enter a kind of sleep mode for signal reception.
With a few other techniques also added to the line-up (for geeks, they are: cross-slot scheduling, maximum MIMO layer adaptation, and fast transition out of connected state), smartphones should be able to last longer before requiring a recharge.
Much of the hype surrounding 5G speeds relates to the use of new high-frequency bandwidths more commonly known as mmWave; the wavelengths are literally 1 millimeter. But the problem is that it’s subject to all sorts of environmental factors — a heavy rainstorm could reduce speeds to a trickle — and crazy small footprints that could make coverage range even worse than WiFi.
This requires operators to roll out more base stations and place them closer together. But doing so also requires more connections to the core network — known as backhaul. Normally this is done via some sort of cable, eg, fiber optic.
Release 16, however, supports integrated access and backhaul, meaning that telecom operators can add mmWave base stations without the need to run a cable to the cell site, though it will still need electricity. Instead, they can use wireless frequencies to provide both consumer access and network backhaul, which should cut both the time and cost of rolling out more stations and help boost coverage.
A collection of other additions, each seemingly minor, will also improve the way smartphones move between existing Long-Term Evolution (4G) networks and the new 5G systems. While there’s a lot of expectation surrounding the faster 5G networks, the reality is that operators and smartphones will generally be switching between the old and the new. If done well, consumers will barely notice the difference in speeds and reliability. But to make it happen seamlessly, Release 16 offers enhancements that will make the transition between the networks more efficient.
As these new specifications trickle through the industry, from handset and equipment vendors to telecom operators, consumers can expect to see their fancy new 5G handsets start to approach the speeds they’re paying for.

X  AMD-Xilinx Deal  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will buy 5G chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) for $35 billion in stock. AMD will pay 1.7234 shares for each Xilinx share, or $143 a share as of Monday s close.  The AMD-Xilinx deal follows the recent Nvidia (NVDA) deal to buy U.K. wireless chip designer Arm Holdings from Softbank for $40 billion.  AMD also reported third-quarter earnings that were well above views. It also guided higher on Q4 revenue. AMD earnings had been scheduled for Tuesday night.  The AMD-Xilinx deal had been rumored a few weeks earlier.  AMD stock fell 1% early Tuesday, slashing initial losses on the Xilinx deal news. Xilinx surged 13%.  Meanwhile, Twilio (TWLO), Chegg (CHGG) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) reported earnings after the close. Dexcom (DXCM) reported revenue a day early and announced the retirement of a key executive.  Dow Jones giants Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and Merck (MRK) also reported.  Heavy Market Losses Monday  The stock market rally suffered heavy losses Monday amid soaring coronavirus cases and a big tech warning. The major indexes broke key support, at least intraday, and leading stocks suffered significant chart damage but rallied somewhat into the news on stimulus deal news.  The major indexes started Monday with modest losses and initially improved, but soon reversed sharply lower. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq all fell through their 50-day moving averages, though the latter closed slightly above that key level due to stimulus-deal buzz.  German software maker SAP (SAP) plunged 23% on its big warning, which hit several other software makers as well. But growth names were broadly lower as spiking coronavirus cases finally took center stage on Wall Street, with Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Google stock all down about 3%.  Bucking the trend were Apple stock, AMD and Amazon.com (AMZN), all ending with fractional gains.  Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live.  Key Earnings Late Monday  Twilio earnings topped views, but the communications software maker guided to a wider Q4 loss. Twilio stock, which closed just out of buy range, fell a fraction before the open. Online education player Chegg beat views and guided up for Q4 and 2021. Chegg stock fell 4% early Tuesday after momentarily topping a buy point Monday morning.  NXP Semiconductors reported a smaller-than-expected Q3 loss and topped on revenue after giving strong preliminary revenue figures earlier this month. The automotive and wireless-chip maker also guided higher for Q4 revenue. NXP stock rose 3% in extended trade after pulling back Monday; it s still in range from a flat-base buy point.  Dexcom reported stronger-than-expected revenue but said Chief Commercial Officer Rick Doubleday, who oversaw sales, marketing and customer service, will retire at the end of the year. Dexcom stock tumbled 5.5% before the open after recently regaining its 50-day line. The maker of diabetes products will release its full earnings report late Tuesday as scheduled.  Microsoft Earnings Kick Off Tech Giants  After Monday s sell-off, it s even more important that leading stocks and especially tech giants deliver strong results. Microsoft is on tap late Tuesday, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and many more slated for Thursday night.  When Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Amazon and Google stock (all with more than $1 trillion market caps) move, they can move markets. Facebook stock isn t far off at $787 billion. Apple earnings and guidance could influence iPhone chipmakers, while Microsoft may provide a shot in the arm — or the gut — for software makers after the SAP (SAP) meltdown.  Stimulus Deal Buzz  Stimulus deal buzz helped buoy stocks late in the session. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stimulus-deal talks continued Monday. Pelosi said the only real issue left is an agreement on testing and tracing language, but that s been the main sticking point on a stimulus deal for quite some time.  The odds of a pre-election stimulus deal seem next to nil at this point. The Senate is due to leave town for the final week of election campaigning, with the House already out. Then again, with Election Day so close, a post-election coronavirus aid package may not be so negative.  Once the election is out of the way, a Pelosi-Mnuchin stimulus deal could come relatively soon. However, Senate Republicans are reluctant to support such a hefty price tag.  Microsoft stock is on IBD Leaderboard and IBD Long-Term Leaders. Amazon stock, AMD, Microsoft and Chegg are on the IBD 50.  Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures rose 0.4% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.6%. Remember that premarket action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn t necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.  Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks  Coronavirus News  Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 43.85 million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.16 million.  Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 8.96 million, with deaths above 231,000.  Pfizer (PFE) reported mixed results before the open, and didn t provide an interim analysis on its coronavirus vaccine candidate.  Pfizer and partner BioNTech (BNTX) could provide coronavirus vaccine efficacy data any day, with a possible FDA approval request by late November.  Meanwhile, an Eli Lilly (LLY) coronavirus antibody treatment came up short. Along with an earnings miss and weak guidance, Lilly stock fell.  Stock Market Rally Monday  U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 27686.04 -649.53 -2.29 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3401.05 -64.34 -1.86 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 11358.94 -189.34 -1.64 Russell 2000 (IWM) 159.56 -3.51 -2.15 IBD 50 (FFTY) 37.48 -0.85 -2.22 Last Update: 4:14 PM ET 10/26/2020  The stock market rally suffered serious losses, though the major indexes closed off their worst levels, especially the Nasdaq.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 2.3% in Monday s stock market trading. The S&P 500 index fell 1.9%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.6%. While the Nasdaq closed above its 50-day line, the Nasdaq 100 did not.  Surging coronavirus cases in the U.S. and Europe understandably took a toll on airlines, hotels and ""real economy"" stocks broadly. But the SAP warning also showed that software and other tech names also could come under pressure from the resurgent coronavirus pandemic.  Microsoft fell 2.8%, knifing through its 50-day line. Facebook sank 2.7% and Google lost 3% but are still somewhat above their 50-day lines.  Apple stock managed to close up 1 cent on Monday, Amazon up 0.1% and AMD 0.3%, though only the latter managed to close back above its 50-day. While all three stocks have handles, Apple s and AMD s are flawed because their midpoints are below the midpoints of their bases.  Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 2.2%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) lost 2.5%, with Microsoft stock a major holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) pulled back 2.1%, even with AMD stock providing a fractional boost.  Stock Market Rally Analysis  Monday s sell-off came after the major indexes and many top stocks had already pulled back to many support levels. There wasn t much room left before the stock market rally would start to show serious weakness.  The heavy losses also put in context how modest Friday s 0.4% Nasdaq bounce was.  The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all broke below their 21-day exponential moving averages and straight through their 50-day lines. All the major indexes have fallen back below their September highs, which had served as short-term highs. The Dow Jones fell under the low of its Sept. 30 follow-through day, a negative sign.  Could the stock market rally rebound over the next few days or weeks? Absolutely. Perhaps Monday s sell-off will mark the end of a shakeout, though that case could have been made several times in the past two weeks.  Earnings reports, coronavirus vaccine news and election results all could buoy the major indexes and leading stocks. But those hypothetical tailwinds could end up being headwinds. Or a mix of major positive and negative crosswinds roil the markets and your psyche.  One or two strong market days would be a relief, but would not necessarily signal a bright green light to ramp up exposure. But one or two bad days would make the major indexes look bad, with more failed breakouts or broken charts.  Catch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmith  What To Do Now  In this environment, investors should be cautious. Your exposure likely will be coming down as you take profits on round-tripping holdings or cut losses. Meanwhile, there are few good options for starting new positions right now. But keep updating your watchlists. If the market rally revs higher, many leading stocks will quickly offer buy points.  But as the past two weeks have shown, when the stock market rally pulls back, it s hard to make money.

On today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks, Ben Rains looks at the broader earnings picture as Wall Street prepares for a busy week of earnings results from some of the biggest names in technology. The episode then dives into Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL ahead of their quarterly financial releases to help figure out of either tech giant’s stock is worth buying.
The election is roughly one week away and stocks fell on Monday on the back of growing coronavirus concerns. Wall Street will also be focused on quarterly earnings results from Boeing BA, Mastercard MA, Facebook FB, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. With this in mind, the overall S&P 500 earnings outlook has continued to improve (also read: Previewing Big Tech Earnings).
Today’s episode then dives into Microsoft and Apple. MSFT is set to report after the closing bell on Tuesday and holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment. The company’s Office unit is still vital to businesses, students, and many others, and the pandemic has highlighted the importance of its stay-at-home segments that compete against Zoom Video ZM and others. And it has continued to expand its gaming reach, as it grows more influential in the cloud computing space.
Meanwhile, Apple released the iPhone 12 ahead of the holiday shopping season. Beyond its first 5G-enabled smartphone, investors have grown more focused on its growing services unit that includes its app store, subscription services such as Spotify SPOT competitor Apple Music, its streaming TV platform, news offering, and more. AAPL stock is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment that rests nearly 15% off its 52-week highs.

Fears about soaring coronavirus infection rates around the world and uncertainty over the presidential election next Tuesday left market participants struggling to figure out which way stocks should move, and that left gravity to impose itself. The Nasdaq closed with a loss of 1.6%.  As difficult as it is to see the stock market fall, there are a lot of positives that are providing some support to the market. Today, Dunkin  Brands International  joined the growing group of companies that are considering strategic moves in order to bolster their businesses. Also helping to keep the Nasdaq from losing more ground were two stocks that have always had a major impact on the Nasdaq and promise to continue to do so well into the future.  An Inspire-ing deal for Dunkin ?  Dunkin  Brands saw its stock soar 16% on Monday. The doughnut and coffee chain became the latest target of a privately held company that s made some high-profile acquisitions in the restaurant space on several occasions in recent years.  In a strangely vague press release, Dunkin  revealed in its ""statement about possible acquisition"" that Inspire Brands has held preliminary discussions with the doughnut maker. It took third-party reports to learn possible details, including a price of $106.50 per share that would value Dunkin  at roughly $8.8 billion.  Inspire is a holding company that owns a number of other restaurant concepts. Previously known as Arby s Restaurant Group, Inspire purchased Buffalo Wild Wings and Sonic Drive-In in 2018 and then followed that up with the acquisition of sandwich maker Jimmy John s in 2019.  The deal shifts the focus away from Dunkin s earnings report, scheduled for Thursday. Some speculate that if the reports prove accurate, a Dunkin  acquisition could lead the private equity community to look more closely at mergers and acquisitions in the restaurant space.  The big names in the Nasdaq  Playing a more important role in keeping the Nasdaq s losses in check were Apple  and Amazon . Neither stock made huge gains on Monday, but their recovery into the green by the end of the day signaled that investors haven t yet given up on the Nasdaq to make an end-of-year push toward record highs.  Apple is also scheduled to release its latest financial report on Thursday, and investors are anxious to see how the iPhone maker will fare going into the key holiday season. There s been a lot of focus recently on the new iPhone 12 line, which takes advantage of the new 5G capabilities that are starting to emerge among wireless carriers. Many have hoped that the 5G rollout would inspire a big new wave of upgrades among users who ve until now been reticent to pony up for a pricey new smartphone.  Meanwhile, Amazon s shareholders have Thursday marked on their calendars as well to see how the e-commerce giant is doing financially. With the annual Amazon Prime event having just occurred, those following the stock hope Amazon will say something about how it fared. Moreover, because the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed many companies to accelerate their digital transformation efforts, some expect Amazon s Web Services division to post heightened growth rates.  As interesting as deals like a Dunkin  acquisition can be, it s far more important to the health of the Nasdaq s bull market for Amazon and Apple to thrive. Without them, the stock market could quickly reverse course and bring what s been an amazing recovery to an end."

Apple stock ended Monday nearly unchanged.  X  In a note to clients Monday, Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong said Apple could be reluctant to give December-quarter guidance because of the late launch of the iPhone 12 series handsets. Apple typically releases its latest iPhones in September. But the iPhone 12 didn t go on sale until Oct. 23.  ""With only a week of new iPhone sales by the time earnings are reported on Oct. 29, we are unsure that Apple will feel comfortable with guidance,"" Ong said. ""They have not guided officially since January, and for the December quarter, they typically have 1.5 months of new iPhone sales data prior to guidance, a luxury they don t have for this iPhone cycle.""  Ong kept his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 140.  Apple Stock Has Formed Cup-With-Handle Base  On the stock market today, Apple stock rose a penny to 115.05.  Apple stock has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 125.49. But in a negative sign, shares are trading below their 50-day moving average line.  The new base is part of a larger, eight-week consolidation with a buy point of 138.08, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.  Apple Earnings Seen Sliding 7%  Ong expects Apple to post ""solid"" September-quarter results. The work-from-home and learn-from-home trends spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to boost Mac and iPad sales, he said.  Wall Street expects Apple to earn 71 cents a share on sales of $64.16 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. In the year-earlier period, Apple earned 76 cents a share on sales of $64.04 billion. That would translate to a year-over-year decline of 7% in earnings on flat sales.  For the December quarter, analysts are modeling Apple earnings of $1.36 a share, up 9%, on sales of $100.22 billion, up 13%.  Apple Stock Added To  Tactical Outperform  List  Cowen analyst Krish Sankar on Monday reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 133.  He said Apple management on Thursday ""could give color"" on the December quarter ""without providing formal guidance again given the ongoing pandemic.""  Meanwhile, Evercore ISI added Apple stock to its Tactical Outperform stock list. Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani maintained his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 135.  Apple should benefit from a trifecta of the iPhone 12 upgrade supercycle, accelerating services growth and strength in non-iPhone hardware demand, Daryanani said in his report to clients.

Services revenue is expected to rise, but at a slower pace compared to past quarters.  COVID-19 may cause declining revenue after strong growth in Q3 FY 2020.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) posted record financial results in its most recent quarter, Q3 FY 2020, as the company benefitted from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for many of its products surged amid the growth of the work-from-home economy.﻿﻿  Investors will be watching to see if Apple can maintain that growth when it reports earnings on October 29, 2020 for Q4 FY 2020.﻿﻿ The company s fiscal year ended in September. Analysts expect year-over-year (YOY) declines in both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, marking the first drops since fiscal 2019.﻿﻿  Investors also will focus on a key metric in the Q4 results: the iPhone maker s services revenue. Apple has long been known for its hardware products, such as smartphones and computers. But it s aggressively diversifying by expanding revenue from services, thus reducing its dependence on hardware sales.﻿﻿ Analysts expect Apple to report healthy growth in services revenue YOY.﻿﻿  Apple s success this year has been reflected in its stock, which has outperformed the broader market. Apple shares have provided a total return of 91.1% over the past 12 months, well above the S&P 500 s total return of 15.3%, as of October 23, 2020.  Source: TradingView.  The stock jumped after the company posted record quarterly results that beat analysts  expectations in Q3 FY 2020.﻿﻿ EPS rose a robust 18.4% YOY, the second-fastest pace of growth in the past seven quarters. Revenue grew 10.9%, marking the fastest pace since Q4 FY 2018.﻿﻿  The growth was broad based across the company s geographic segments and in both products and services.﻿﻿ It was also a definite improvement from the more modest EPS growth of 3.8% and anemic revenue growth of 0.5% posted in Q2 FY 2020.﻿﻿ After Apple s July 30 earnings report, the stock advanced until early September. Since then the stock has drifted downward and sideways.  Analysts are currently forecasting a slump in revenue and earnings in Q4 FY 2020. EPS is expected to decline 9.3% YOY, the largest drop since Q2 FY 2019. Revenue is expected to fall 1.1%, the first decline since Q2 FY 2019. For full-year 2020, analysts expect EPS and revenue to rise 8.5% and 4.9%, respectively, an improvement from the annual declines posted for both numbers in FY 2019.﻿﻿"

Stocks declined sharply Monday to kick off a week heavy with earnings from U.S. tech giants as coronavirus infections surge, stimulus negotiations remain at a stalemate and investors prepare for the presidential election more than a week away.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 776 points, or 2.74%, to 27,558, the S&P 500 tumbled 2.27% and the Nasdaq slumped 2.18%.  TheStreet s Katherine Ross discussed breaking news in the stock market. Cramer spoke about his expectations from Apple and Twitter s stock after it reports earnings and Dunkin s potential sale to Inspire Brands.  Apple: Buy Or Sell?  Apple (AAPL) - Get Report is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and analysts expect the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant to post earnings of 71 cents a share on revenue of $64.16 billion.  Cramer said to buy Apple after it reports earnings. ""There is an expectation from the bulls today that Tim Cook is going to give very positive guidance. And if you were in Tim Cook s shoes it makes no sense to do so.""  Twitter: Buy Or Sell?  Twitter (TWTR) - Get Report reports its earnings later this week. Twitter was attacked by President Trump over the way it handled a recent article from the New York Post. That didn t help the stock. Shares of the tech giant continue to waver, but overall the trend still looks favorable for the social media stock.  Cramer said Twitter might be a speculative buy because it s not FAANG. ""The last quarter for Twitter was very good but Twitter has been uneven. Its stock has moved significantly and if this trend is for real then Twitter might be worth picking up in what I consider an abysmal morning where people are selling everything.""  Dunkin s Potential Sale to Inspire Brands  Dunkin is looking at a potential $9 billion sale to Inspire Brands, which is listed as a portfolio holding of Roark Capital. “Dunkin’ Brands confirms that it has held preliminary discussions to be acquired by Inspire Brands. There is no certainty that any agreement will be reached. Neither group will comment further unless and until a transaction is agreed,” company spokeswoman, Karen Raskopf, said in a statement released to TheStreet on Sunday.  Cramer said there is a recognition about the mom and pop coffee shop which for many people has always been a mainstay. ""Those of us who love coffee are willing to go to Dunkin like Starbucks but also like the local coffee store. The local coffee store doesn t have the capital to be able to handle this downturn. The coffee shops are so thinly capitalized that if I were Dunkin which definitely needs more space to expand, it s getting it.""

50,2020-10-26,14:47:00,AAPL,https://www.investopedia.com/best-dividend-stocks-4774650?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral,Best Dividend Stocks for November 2020,"For decades, income-minded investors have searched for the best dividend stocks out there. In my experience, the main criteria to look for when betting on great dividend stocks include a history of strong fundamentals, increasing dividend distributions over time, great entry points (technicals), and a history of bullish trading activity in the shares.  The hallmark way I go about finding the best dividend stocks – the outliers – is by looking for quiet unusual trading activity. Oftentimes, that can be institutional activity – i.e. big money. I ll go over what that unusual trading activity looks like in a bit. But the five stocks I see as long-term dividend growth candidates are Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY), Walmart Inc. (WMT), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD), Apple Inc. (AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT).  Over decades, I ve learned that the true tell on great stocks is that big money consistently finds its way into the best companies out there – especially dividend-paying stocks. Some of the biggest returns ever have come from holding stocks for many years and reinvesting dividends. I am a very long-term minded person and see dividend investing as a pillar in personal finance and financial independence.  I take a well-rounded approach and rank each stock by technicals (long-term), fundamentals (long-term), and if there is big money supporting the stock. I want the odds on my side when looking for the highest-quality dividend stocks ... and I own many of them. Many times, when a stock is under pressure, it s worthy of inspection. As stock prices head lower, the dividend yield increases. That is important for dividend seekers.  Up first is Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY), which is a leading pharmaceutical company that is consistently growing and raising its dividend. When deciding on a strong candidate for long-term dividend growth, I like to look for stocks showing near-term muted performance:  One-month performance: +1.46%  Historical big money buy signals  Just to show you graphically how I like to look at stocks, below are the big money signals Bristol-Myers has made the last year. Green bars are showing that Bristol-Myers stock was likely being bought by an institution according to MAPsignals, while red bars indicate selling. Recently, there has been some red. Buying on dips can offer higher yields to a dividend investor.  www.mapsignals.com; end-of-day data sourced from Tiingo.com  On top of technicals, when deciding on the best dividend stock, you should look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Bristol-Myers Squibb has a strong dividend history:  Three-year dividend growth rate: +3.2%  Current dividend per share: $0.45  Forward yield: 2.99%  Three-year earnings growth rate: +63.88%  Next up is Walmart Inc. (WMT), which is a leading superstore chain. Walmart has a long dividend history, and shares have been in an uptrend recently. When deciding on a strong candidate for long-term dividend growth, it s a good idea to look for many years of dividend increases. Let s look at Walmart s recent performance:  One-month performance: +4.81%  Recent big money signals  Below are the big money signals that Walmart has made the past year. It is clear that the stock has seen green recently.  www.mapsignals.com; end-of-day data sourced from Tiingo.com  On top of technicals, when deciding on the best dividend stock, you should look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Walmart has a nice dividend history:  Three-year dividend growth rate: +2%  Current dividend per share: $0.54  Forward yield: 1.5%  Three-year earnings growth rate: +24.36%  Next, I m looking at The Home Depot, Inc. (HD), which is a leading home improvement company with a solid dividend history. When deciding on a strong candidate for long-term dividend growth, recent performance in the shares is important:  One-month performance: +3.92%  Recent big money signals  Below are the big money signals that Home Depot stock has made over the past year. It is clear that the stock has been in a nice uptrend:  www.mapsignals.com; end-of-day data sourced from Tiingo.com  On top of technicals, when deciding on the best dividend stock, you should look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Home Depot has a strong dividend history:  Three-year dividend growth rate: +25.4%  Current dividend per share: $1.50  Forward yield: 2.12%  Three-year earnings growth rate: +17.29%  Next, I m looking at Apple Inc. (AAPL), which is a leading consumer electronics company. The shares have been on a tear for years. When deciding on a strong candidate for long-term dividend growth, muted performance is not a bad thing:  One-month performance: +0.07%  Recent big money signals  Below are the big money signals that Apple stock has made over the past year.  www.mapsignals.com; end-of-day data sourced from Tiingo.com  On top of technicals, when deciding on the best dividend stock, you should look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Apple has a strong dividend history.  Three-year dividend growth rate: +11.2%  Current dividend per share: $0.205  Forward yield: 0.71%  Three-year earnings growth rate: +13.4%  Lastly, I m looking at Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), which is a leading software company. When deciding on a strong candidate for long-term dividend growth, I like to look for recent leaders:  One-month performance: +3.24%  Historical big money signals  Below are the big money signals that Microsoft stock has made over the past year.  www.mapsignals.com; end-of-day data sourced from Tiingo.com  On top of technicals, when deciding on the best dividend stock, you should look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Microsoft has been a steady grower:  Three-year dividend growth rate: +9.2%  Current dividend per share: $0.56  Forward yield: 1.04%  Three-year earnings growth rate: +43.33%  The Bottom Line  Bristol-Myers Squibb, Walmart, Home Depot, Apple, and Microsoft represent a potential buying opportunity for the long-term dividend investor. Given the strong historical dividend growth and big money signals in the shares, these stocks could be worth a spot in a yield-oriented portfolio.

51,2020-10-26,13:57:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-ceo-the-lack-of-stimulus-is-taking-its-toll-175700027.html,Walmart CEO: The lack of stimulus is taking its toll,"Attention lawmakers: get a new stimulus done now, because your dillydallying is hurting U.S. consumers and businesses.
“I think the lack of stimulus is showing up more so with those unemployed, small businesses and people that need help. I think it’s important that we all understand in some ways we are having a shared experience because we are in a pandemic together, but we are having a very different experience. If you have been let go and don’t have income, you really need help. The voice we have at Walmart is to say to Congress and the administration we need you to help those people who need help,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit.
Stimulus from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act in the form of an unemployment payment top up and direct checks to people greatly helped Walmart and the broader retail sector in the spring.
Walmart’s U.S. same-store sales surged 9.3% in the second quarter, led by general merchandise and food. Rivals such as Target, Kroger and Albertson’s also saw outsized quarterly sales gains. But consumer spending slowed down into September — and now into October — as stimulus has run its course. The lack of stimulus —and any insight into when a new deal will get passed amid a contentious election season —stands to highlight the struggles of lower income Americans in coming months.
Among lower-income Americans, a recent Pew Research study showed that 46% surveyed had trouble paying their bills since the pandemic began. Roughly one-third have had difficulty making rent or mortgage payments.
The financial stress stems from how the pandemic has uprooted the U.S. economy, leading to sweeping layoffs. Pew found that 25% of adults say they or someone in their household was laid off or lost a job due to the pandemic. Roughly 15% said job loss happened to them personally.
Despite the economic uncertainty, McMillon is hopeful on the crucial holiday shopping season.
“I think people want to celebrate the holiday. Hopefully families will take steps to do that in a safe manner. But we all need some love and joy, and this time of year brings those things top of mind. We’ll find a way to celebrate it and it will be a good year. It will be unique, but a good year,” says McMillon.

The wireless earbuds have become an important growth engine for Apple and have been a hit with users since they debuted in late 2016.  The company is working on the second generation of the high-end AirPods Pro, as well as the third iteration of the original, entry level AirPods, according to the report, citing people familiar with the plans.  This could mark a major redesign for the popular device, with a shorter stem for the AirPods, while potentially eliminating it altogether on the AirPods Pro. Apple is also testing a more rounded design that better fills the user s ear.  As sales of its flagship iPhone have slowed, Apple has increasingly turned to its other products and services to generate growth. Wearables, which include AirPods, Apple Watch, and Beats products, have been an area of increasing importance for the company, growing significantly faster than any other area of Apple s business. In fact, as the overall wearables market has taken off, Apple s share has grown even faster.  During the second quarter, the market for wearable devices grew 14% year over year, according to industry watcher International Data. At the same time, Apple s wearable shipments grew 25%, as the company continued to gain market share, which grew to 34%, up from 31% in the prior-year quarter."

Whether that leads to a fresh wave of toilet paper and disinfecting wipes out of stocks this winter like those seen in March is the great unknown right now.
“Things are getting better, but we have a ways to go to recover. It will be choppy for months to come as we all deal with the volatility and as things change,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said of product out of stocks at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit. Working closely with key suppliers to keep shelves stocked is of the utmost importance for Walmart, McMillon said.
“Today there has been some leveling out, but with the case counts coming back up there are some areas we see stock-up behavior again locally,” said McMillon of current consumer behaviors,
Consumers continuing to keep their homes stocked with essentials such as cleaning products and frozen food have led to some big quarterly reports from consumer staples this month. The likes of Conagra Brands (frozen food), Procter & Gamble (cleaning products), PepsiCo (soda and chips) and Kimberly-Clark (paper products) all reported strong sales gains in the U.S. for their most recent quarters. Sales and profit outlooks have skewed bullish on the view that demand will stay strong into year-end.
The recent trend in COVID-19 infections underscores the renewed re-stocking movement.
The U.S. has hit a new high in the number of daily COVID-19 infections, according to an analysis done by Time. It has surpassed the peak reached in mid-July. The country also marked a new single-day record of infections on Oct. 23.

54,2020-10-26,12:49:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-buy-ceo-corie-barry-the-covid-19-pandemic-has-made-me-a-better-leader-164928938.html,Best Buy CEO Corie Barry: The COVID-19 pandemic has made me a better leader,"Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Barry has been in constant motion this year managing a 1,200 store-plus retailer that America and Canada has leaned on to buy essential work-from-home gear and services during the COVID-19 pandemic (and more recently, home renovation stuff like appliances).
So it’s understandable that Barry, 44, hasn’t had profound amounts of time to ponder how the pandemic has changed her as a leader. But, it’s clear Barry — who took over as CEO in June 2019 from the well-respected Hubert Joly — has reflected on it a bit when chatting with us at this year’s Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit. No doubt her insight is helpful to fellow leaders right now managing through tattered financial statements and concerned employees.
“I think for me, it has underscored a couple of things. The first is my own philosophy about the role of a CEO is to create the conditions for other amazing leaders to be successful and to move as quickly as we move to make the decisions. It s not just about me sitting alone in my office, checking out decisions. It s about using and leveraging and unleashing the leaders around me. And that philosophy has actually only held more true during the time of the pandemic,” Barry explained.
Continued Barry, “I think that the second big piece here for me is that it s a very personal time for people. This isn t just about, go do your work, and it s separate from your personal life. I think everyone s work and personal lives are very combined. We have what we call inclusive leadership behaviors at Best Buy. And they are empathy, courage, vulnerability, and grace. And those leadership behaviors are not something you always hear a corporation talk about. But I think in a time where our personal lives and professional lives are so intertwined, not being afraid to exhibit those behaviors is crucial for our teams right now.”
Barry’s leadership philosophy is etched all over her approach to managing Best Buy since the pandemic kicked into high gear in March. Many on the Street credit her decisive leadership as being ahead of others in retail and earning a good amount of goodwill among consumers and workers.
It was a painful decision for Barry — who is beloved by store workers because she climbed to the top of Best Buy over a 20-year career at the retailer—but she was forced to furlough 51,000 workers in April. The decision preserved Best Buy’s financials (which showed off her experience as former Best Buy CFO) at a time of incredible uncertainty as stores were closed and services limited. Barry cut her salary in half, and executives that report to her took a 20% pay reduction. The board — led by former Domino’s Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle since June — agreed to receive half their cash retainer fees.
In late April, Barry unveiled a clever appointment-only shopping experience for consumers as stores slowly began to reopen. Come June 15, Best Buy reopened 800 of its stores. On Aug. 2, Best Buy raised its starting minimum wage for U.S. workers to $15 an hour.
Barry said two-thirds of Best Buy’s workers have been brought back from the April furlough.
The quick-thinking by Barry and her team have paid dividends.
Best Buy’s fiscal second quarter enterprise same-store sales rose 5.8%. Domestic online same-store sales surged 242% from a year ago. Earnings per share spiked 58% year-over-year. The company’s stock has risen 48% since March, according to Yahoo Finance Premium data — that’s better than Target (46% gain) and Walmart (25% gain).

That includes everything from keeping stores closed on Thanksgiving to spreading out Black Friday deals throughout November both online and at the store level. And in the case of Macy’s, no more Santa greeting kiddies at its stores.
Indeed this will make the holiday season feel a lot different to shoppers, but welcome to the new normal in retail where safety for workers and consumers is as important as ensuring the latest hot item is well-stocked and gets sold.
“I think what we re trying to avoid is the kind of natural response of lines at stores on Black Friday. That just can t happen,” Best Buy (BBY) CEO Corie Barry said at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit. While most retailers have yet to divulge their Black Friday operating plans in this pandemic-driven world, Best Buy and fellow Minnesota-based rival Target are taking the early leadership positions on shopper safety and crowd control.
Best Buy held a special two-day deals event online on Amazon Prime Day earlier this month. Barry says the next wave of holiday deals will hit at the end of October. The company is also emphasizing different shopping methods in its marketing such as buy online, pick up in store or pick up in parking lot. Same-day delivery options are also being ramped up — helped by 250 stores serving as shipping hubs.
“We have some of our employees doing deliveries. We’re literally trying to make sure we get the customer whatever they want on their terms,” Barry said, adding Best Buy will continue with its rigorous store cleaning protocols adopted during the pandemic as well as store capacity control. Masks will remain a requirement for in-store shopping.
Best Buy stores will be closed on Thanksgiving.
Added Barry, “We are trying to make sure the customer feels like they are in control. And then making sure whatever they choose, we deliver it as safely as possible.”

The U.S. recorded a record number of confirmed cases on Friday, with many states driving the increase. On top of the COVID-19 surge, a stimulus bill getting signed before the election is looking less likely as the days tick away without an agreement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down about 2.4% at 11:45 a.m. EDT on Monday.  Apple  was down less than the market on Monday following some analyst optimism regarding the iPhone 12 and the company s vast services business. Other stocks in the Dow exposed to a worsening pandemic didn t fare as well.  Apple tapped to outperform  Expectations of strong demand for non-iPhone products, an acceleration of the services segment, and a big upgrade cycle for the iPhone 12 have led analysts at Evercore to put Apple stock on its ""tactical outperform"" list. Evercore also maintained its outperform rating and its $135 price target.  Evercore sees the potential for Apple s fiscal 2021 results to outpace analyst expectations, driven by a higher average selling price for iPhones, new service offerings, and solid sales of Macs and iPads. The iPhone 12 family raises the base price from the iPhone 11 family, although a slightly cheaper iPhone 12 Mini will become an option in November.  Evercore does concede that results for the next couple of quarters may not impress. For the quarter ending in September, a lack of new iPhone models and the availability of the budget-priced iPhone SE could drag down iPhone sales. For the quarter ending in December, Evercore is worried about Apple s gross margins.  The company is launching new iPhones into a U.S. economy that has been both ravaged by the pandemic and propped up by the $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in March. That stimulus bill, which sent checks to Americans and added a weekly $600 supplement to unemployment payments, almost certainly contributed to Apple s strong results during the pandemic.  With a winter wave of COVID-19 looking like a certainty, a lack of new stimulus could make Apple s pricey new iPhones a tough sell for consumers over the next few months. An iPhone 12 supercycle is possible, but it s far from guaranteed.  Shares of the tech giant were down about 0.7% by late Monday morning. Apple stock is still up roughly 56% so far this year.  Stocks drop on COVID-19 exposure  Every Dow stock was in the red just before lunch time on Monday as cases of COVID-19 surge across the country. Notable losses include a 4% decline for American Express , a 3.7% decline for Boeing , and a 3.1% decline for Disney .  American Express depends on travel and entertainment spending, both of which have been gutted by the pandemic. The credit card giant reported a 20% sales decline for its third quarter last Friday, and the company maintained a cautious outlook. With the pandemic surging in the U.S. and Europe, American Express may be in for a tough winter.  Boeing is in a similar situation. Demand for air travel has plummeted due to the pandemic, and a record-setting wave of the virus this winter won t help. Daily passenger traffic through airport security checkpoints is still down around 60%; a full recovery could take years if the economy is slow to rebound. Airline bankruptcies could further roil the industry, although additional airline bailouts are a possibility.  Disney still hasn t reopened its Disneyland resort in California, although Disney World in Florida has been open since July. A third wave of the coronavirus will make reopening difficult in the coming months, and there s no guarantee that Disney World will remain open if the pandemic gets bad enough. Disney is doubling down on streaming to make up for lost revenue elsewhere, but it will be tough going for the iconic company, at least for the next few months.  The market is starting to worry about the pandemic again, punishing stocks exposed to renewed stay-at-home orders. There will eventually be a light at the end of the tunnel, but right now the winter is looking bleak for many pandemic-exposed stocks."

Apple (AAPL) - Get Report plans to update its AirPods earbuds, releasing two new models next year, according to a media report.  The Cupertino, Calif., technology giant will remodel its third-generation entry-level AirPods to have a shorter stem, replaceable ear tips, and a possibly improved battery life, Bloomberg reported.  Apple will also launch AirPods Pro earbuds, which will be more compact and smaller in size because the short stem at the bottom will be eliminated.  The current model being tested includes a more rounded shape that fills more of a user’s ear and has a design similar to models from Samsung, Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report, and Google (GOOGL) - Get Report, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.  Apple also plans to launch new wireless chips to power both models.  The company faced challenges integrating noise-cancellation, wireless antennas, and microphones into a smaller AirPods casing, which could result in a less perfect design when the product is finalized, Bloomberg reported.  AirPods have gained in popularity since they were launched in 2016. They were most recently updated in March 2019. AirPods Pro was released last October.  The company’s wearables, home and accessories division, which includes AirPods, posted $6.5 billion in revenue in the last quarter, increasing around 70% from 2018.  Earlier this month, Apple launched several new products, including the long-awaited 5G-capable iPhone 12.  Apple unveiled four different iPhone models, including the iPhone 12 mini, a 5.4-inch model starting at $699; a 6.1-inch device starting at $799, a 6.1-inch Pro model starting at $999, and a 6.7-inch pro model starting at $1,099.

“I don’t know why he should.”
Cramer said the adoption to 5G is early, and while phone companies like Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T are ramping up promotions to get iPhone 12s into customer hands, he still thinks COVID-19 could impact how quickly the phone sells. 
“Tim Cook is a wise person.”

Here s a sample of Wall Street s commentary.  Apple (AAPL) - Get Report is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and analysts expect the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant to report earnings of 71 cents a share on revenue of $64.16 billion.  Apple shares were at last check were 0.7% higher at $115.88.  Here is what Wall Street is saying about Apple ahead of its earnings release.  Deutsche Bank (Reiterates Buy Rating, $140 PT)  We expect a solid Sept-quarter report from AAPL, but see investors overlooking any recent strength/weakness and focusing on the December quarter given the recent iPhone release and impact on guidance and the March quarter beyond, as this is the first time that all new iPhone products are a month or more delayed.  Long term we continue to believe that AAPL is the best name to own in the IT hardware landscape, outweighing our worries regarding the large year-to-date rise and subsequent valuation expansion.  - Jeriel Ong  JPMorgan (Reiterates Overweight Rating, $150 PT)  Relative to the near term, we envision limited near-term upside on iPhone volume estimates. [But we] would not rule out upside in the upcoming quarter through sustained tailwinds from work-from-home/e-learning trends as well as wearables sales; although, in entirety still only driving modest upside relative to recent quarters.  With regard to implications on the 5G cycle from the upcoming print, the focus will be on guidance, which we forecast to track above expectations despite understandable cautiousness driven by the limited visibility into sales velocity for the yet to launch iPhone 12 Pro Max and 12 mini.  -Samik Chatterjee  RBC Capital (Reiterates Outperform Rating, $132 PT)  In our inaugural edition, we surveyed over 800 Apple and Android (GOOGL) - Get Report users in the U.S. regarding their device usage and buying intentions. We believe the results bode well for AAPL s newly released 5Genabled phones, which we expect will kick off a multiyear upgrade cycle.

Apple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote
Let’s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.
The Services segment became the new cash cow for Apple, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding subscriber base of Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Arcade gaming are likely to have benefited the top line in fourth-quarter fiscal 2020. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apple currently has more than 550 million paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.Additionally, Apple’s endeavor to broaden its ecosystem through partnerships with Amazon AMZN is a positive for the Services segment. Further, Apple Music’s availability on Amazon Echo devices and Fire TV is helping it expand its footprint and compete better with Spotify SPOT and YouTube Music.During fiscal fourth quarter, Apple announced two new live global radio offerings on Apple Music. Beats 1 was made available, renamed as Apple Music 1. Two additional radio stations, Apple Music Hits, celebrating favorite songs from the ’80s, ’90s, and 2000s, and Apple Music Country, spotlighting country music, were also launched.Moreover, Apple Pay is expected to have witnessed surge in activity as quarantined customers used digital and contactless tools to handle their financial activities. Notably, in June, the company launched Apple Card Monthly Installments for more products in its U.S. stores. The program offers 0% interest to customers buying Apple devices.Further, during the to-be-reported quarter, Apple introduced several new features for Apple News and Apple News+, including audio stories of some of the best feature stories from Apple News+.The company also announced the availability of a CBS All Access and SHOWTIME bundle for only $9.99 per month after a seven-day free trial for Apple TV+ subscribers in the United States.These initiatives are expected to have further strengthened user base for Apple Music, News and TV+ services in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Services currently stands at $14.03 billion, indicating 12.1% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.
Apple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 44.3% of net sales in the last-reported quarter wherein sales inched up 1.7% year over year to $26.42 billion.Although Apple expects iPhone SE sales to be strong, we believe that it might not be enough to drive year-over-year growth. This is partly because of stiff competition in China, Apple’s largest international market, from the likes of Huawei.Moreover, President Donald Trump’s threat to ban Tencent’s TCEHY WeChat is expected to have negatively impacted iPhone sales in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, we believe consumers were likely to have postponed buying new iPhones as Apple was set to launch iPhone 12 with 5G support in October.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for iPhone sales currently stands at $28.06 billion, indicating an 18.9% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.

It s the documentary about whistleblower Edward Snowden blowing his whistle. I saw it right after its 2014 release. Whether you feel Snowden is a hero or a traitor isn t at issue here – the issue is that big brother is alive, well, and certainly stronger than it was in 2014.  The government, along with the world s largest companies, watch, listen, monitor, record, and archive every electronic interaction you have with the outside world. Or worse: your inside world. Snowden s point was to educate global citizens that their privacy was both compromised and exploited.  Think about it – all of your ""free"" or even paid services make you the currency. Free email services like Gmail, AOL, or Yahoo archive your every conversation. Every internet search tied to your IP address is logged. Think of the worst thing you ever searched – it s out there forever.  As is everything you ve ever said or looked at on Facebook, Inc. (FB) and its Instagram platform, Snap Inc. (SNAP), etc. In addition, Siri on your Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone is always listening, along with Amazon.com, Inc s (AMZN) Alexa, Alphabet Inc. s (GOOGL) Google Home Assistant, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. s (SSNLF) Bixby.  Your location, purchasing habits, and commuting times are all stored. At home, you re watched by computer webcams. And who uses cash anymore? Every time you swipe your credit card or use Apple Pay or a similar service, it just adds to your profile.  There exists a digital fingerprint representation of you that is so detailed and accurate, all someone needs is to get a well-studied lookalike to replace you. This is what Snowden realized and decided to go public with. The truly scary part is that everyone has become so reliant on modern ease-of-life. So, when the whistle blew, the aftermath was short-lived and didn’t result in any major government change.  It s like that funny scene in ""Ghostbusters"" when Louis is hunted by the dog-like beast outside Tavern on the Green. He screams in horror for help. The diners stop in silence, watch him get attacked, and then after two seconds return to their conversations as if nothing happened.  We are the same. Why? Because we all know it s happening and say: ""I have nothing to hide."" We quietly accept that the tradeoff for convenience is our freedom of privacy. But imagine life without all this convenience! ""It s not worth it, and I couldn t get off the grid even if I tried. And I m such a small actor in this huge play – there s nothing I can do.""  That s the level of chilling insight I got working Wall Street s biggest stock deals in the early 2000s. The big boys run the show, and even my actions as a professional were a drop in the ocean.  Then, I realized that the power lay in tracking the big money. I didn t have to know who or even where they were. I just had to try and track and record their moves. That s when the idea of stalking silent big money began. If I could see what the masses couldn t, I could flip the odds from against me to for me.  I started in 2002 and never looked back. I wanted to give the disadvantaged average investor like me the upper hand by being able to surf the big money that really drives markets. I felt I could predict with a degree of accuracy which stocks would rise. All because I did something even better than becoming a big money player: I figured out a way to watch all of them safely from afar. It s like I created stock market night vision goggles.  The single broadest gauge born out of this is the Big Money Index. It tells us when aggregate big money is buying or selling. That information is immensely powerful. Looking at a Big Money Index chart, it s clear: big money investors often know and act ahead of market moves. Not because they know before (which is true), but they often dictate the moves by their actions:  ​www.mapsignals.com  Notice that, in January, big money buying slowed and reversed. Stocks kept rising until February, when the reality of coronavirus set in. Big money began selling a full month earlier. Then, in March, the market became deeply oversold. We were sending in the marines to buy great stocks. Big money rocketed and lifted the entire market with it.  Then in September, stocks began to sag consistent with pre-election risk-off. But look how the Big Money Index began falling slowly from July and then accelerated its drop in late August. (We just completed a white paper on the Big Money Index.)  Let s face the hard truth: the big forces will always have the upper hand. Big corporations, governments, and money will always use their natural advantage. So, the natural conclusion is: ""Who am I to do anything about it?""  But there is something you can do about it: flip the script. If you wanted to get off the grid, you could use encrypted email, delete your Facebook account, and strictly use cash. Impractical as it may be, it s possible.  But prevailing at stocks may be much easier. You could simply reveal the big money movements – provided you know how. It all has to do with understanding your place. Big money accounts need investors and traders to buy from and more importantly sell to. If you re not watching the big money, odds are that you re the one they need.  Stocks are like free services akin to Facebook, Gmail, Google, etc. How are they all free? If you can t figure out what the product is, you re the product.  The Bottom Line  We (MAPsignals) are bullish on high-quality U.S. equities in the long term, and we see market pullbacks as areas to pick up great companies.

64,2020-10-26,09:55:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/verizon-ceo-hans-vestberg-on-leadership-during-a-pandemic-135506210.html,Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg on leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Verizon (VZ) CEO Hans Vestberg said his company’s mission during the coronavirus pandemic is to keep its employees safe and healthy, but also to ensure that its networks are up and running for the hundreds of millions of customers who rely on its services.
“There’s no playbook. I mean, it s not like a bank crisis or a telecom crisis or something that I ve experienced before. This is a crisis on health,” Vestberg told Yahoo Finance at its virtual All Markets Summit. “My leadership philosophy is just accentuated in a crisis like this.”
Vestberg became CEO of Verizon two years ago, after serving as the company’s chief technology officer overseeing its 5G efforts.
“We need to have transparency and communication in these times,” he said. Throughout the pandemic, Verizon has hosted a daily live webcast for employees to ask questions and stay connected. “We have days where more than a hundred thousand employees tune in,” he added.
Unlike dozens of Fortune 500 companies, Verizon has not laid off any of its 135,000 employees during the pandemic. Rather than make cuts when stores were temporarily closed, Verizon committed to retraining nearly 20,000 workers for other roles within the company.
The pandemic has also only amplified the need for high speed 5G coverage. With millions of people now working and learning from home, the importance of connectivity has arguably never been more important.
It’s early in the race for 5G, but Verizon looked to distance itself from the crowd this month when Vestberg shared the stage with Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook to announce the nationwide rollout of 5G at the virtual iPhone 12 event.
Declaring that “5G just got real,” Vestberg also announced that Verizon planned to have Ultra Wideband in 60 U.S. cities by the end of the year.
The telecom giant recently upgraded its profit target for the year as its wireless and broadband business stabilized in the third quarter, despite the effects of the pandemic.
Vestberg also committed to keeping customers connected during this unprecedented economic downturn.
“We decided we re not going to disconnect anyone, any consumer or small or medium businesses because of non-payment. And we are working with all of them in order for them to see that they can continue to refinance. And we even have taken away charges giving them more data. Those were important decisions,” Vestberg said.
Roughly 90% of Verizon’s 1.2 million customers who signed up for bill relief had made some payment by the end of September, and more than half were paid in full.
Vestberg said history will judge Corporate America by how it responds to the pandemic.
“These are unprecedented times and our employees are going to remember this time, our customers are going to remember, and clearly our shareholders will remember,” Vestberg said.
Verizon is the parent company of Yahoo Finance.

66,2020-10-26,09:20:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q4-earnings-preview-analysts-132008197.html,Apple Q4 Earnings Preview: Analysts Expect Muted Quarter Ahead Of iPhone 12 Strength,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), the first U.S. company to hit the  -trillion market cap landmark,  is scheduled to report its fiscal year 2020 fourth-quarter results Thursday, Oct. 29, after the market close.
Q4 Expectations For Apple:  Analysts, on average, estimate Apple to report earnings per share of 71 cents on revenue of $64.16 billion, according to the Yahoo database.
This compares to EPS of 76 cents and revenue of $64.04 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty estimates EPS of 62 cents and revenues of $60 billion, with iPhone and Services revenues comprising $22.9 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively.
The consensus estimate, which bakes in iPhone revenue of $28.5 billion — assuming 40.4 million shipments and an average selling price of $705 — is too high, the analyst said.
New products typically account for about 47% of iPhone revenue in the fourth quarter, and the just-concluded fourth quarter lacked any new product, she said. 
Investors are likely to brush aside the September quarter iPhone results, given the focus on the iPhone 12, Huberty said.
Related Link:  Why iPhone 12 Will Be Another  Defining Chapter  In Apple s Growth Story 
Optimism On Apple s Future: For the December quarter, the Street is modeling EPS of $1.36 on revenue of $100.22 billion.
""The  iPhone 12 launch  has become a subscription battleground for carriers, as they are all offering sizable promotions to keep or add new customers. We feel these promotions will drive iPhone 12 demand over the next several months,"" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar said in a note.
The analyst raised his iPhone unit estimates for the December quarter by about 8 million units to 73 million units, translating to iPhone revenue of $62.8 billion.
The upside relative to the consensus iPhone revenue estimate of $59.9 million is primarily driven by the firm s carrier subsidy thesis, he said.

Morgan Stanley continues to see upside to both fiscal year 2021 and longer-term EPS estimate for Apple. 
Higher lead times — the time between ordering and receiving a device — over a multi-month period typically signal stronger-than-expected iPhone shipment growth over the cycle, Morgan Stanley s Huberty said.
The initial data points for the iPhone 12 cycle are trending positively, the analyst said. 
As of Oct. 20, average lead times are 18.5 days for the iPhone 12 Pro and 10.1 days for the iPhone 12, she said. 
""That ranks the iPhone 12 Pro third behind the iPhone X and iPhone 11 Pro/Pro Max at this point in the cycle, and ranks the iPhone 12 just behind the iPhone 11 but ahead of the iPhone 8/8 Plus."" 
Morgan Stanley would buy any dip in Apple shares after the Oct. 29 quarterly report on the basis of iPhone 12 strength and positive earnings revisions on the horizon, Huberty said. 
AAPL Stock:  Apple shares added about 27% during the calendar year third quarter and are up a steeper 60% year-to-date. 
Morgan Stanley rates Apple shares with an Outperform and$136 price target.
Piper Sandler reiterated an Overweight rating and increased the price target from $130 to $135.
At last check, Apple shares were slipping 0.8% to $115.94.

67,2020-10-26,09:12:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-adds-cloud-gaming-feature-131233620.html,Facebook adds cloud gaming feature to its platform,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc <FB.O> on Monday launched a free-to-play cloud gaming feature on its social media platform, allowing users to stream and play games like ""Asphalt 9: Legends"" and ""WWE SuperCard"" without downloading them.
""We re not spinning off a separate cloud gaming service,"" the company said in a blog https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/cloud-gaming-meet-facebook-gaming post, adding that all cloud-streamed games can be played on the platform s gaming tab or News Feed.
Facebook s gaming feature is smaller in scale than premium cloud-based game streaming services like Google s <GOOGL.O> Stadia, Nvidia s <NVDA.O> GeForce NOW or Amazon.com s <AMZN.O> Luna, which are competing for users in a high-growth market.
The feature will be available to Android and web users for now, Facebook said, while it was working on alternative options to launch the feature on Apple s <AAPL.O> iOS.
""Apple treats games differently and continues to exert control over a very precious resource,"" the company said, adding it is unsure if launching on Apple s app store is a ""viable"" path."

Twitter, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Twitter, Inc. Quote
Let’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.
Twitter’s ad revenues are expected to have taken a hit since small businesses that primarily use social media platforms are likely to have curbed ad spending as a contingent measure to cope with the coronavirus-led crisis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advertising revenues is pegged at $632 million, indicating a decline of 10% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Though Twitter has become the go-to platform for news about coronavirus, some brands are hesitant to advertise alongside coronavirus discussions on social media platforms. Such companies are likely to have withdrawn ad contracts with Twitter in the to-be-reported quarter for fear of associating their brands with the sensitive topic.Nonetheless, management at Twitter stated that total monetizable DAU (mDAU), which measures the number of users, has been benefiting from frequent discussions on the burning issue of coronavirus and an improving product experience.In the second quarter of 2020, average mDAU was 186 million compared with 139 million in the year-ago quarter and 166 million in the previous quarter.The company’s initiatives to prompt some users to click on links to other websites before retweeting them to stop the spread of misinformation and encourage more thoughtful communication are expected to have helped it expand the monetized user base in the to-be-reported quarter.Twitter’s improved ability to proactively identify and remove abusive content from the platform has been a notable development in this regard.Moreover, the company’s updated policies to ban political ads ahead of the presidential election in the United States on Nov 3 are expected to have boosted trustworthiness of the platform.Further, steady demand for video ad products like Video Website Cards and in-stream pre-roll is likely to have contributed to the top line.
During the quarter, Twitter and WebMD announced a partnership that will bring more WebMD content right to the Twitter feed with video content and Twitter Moments. This will help in educating consumers on health topics. It will also highlight patient stories on what it’s like to live with and manage chronic conditions and other health issues.On Sep 8, Twitter, Bud Light and NFL unveiled Bud Light Showtime Cam that creates a dedicated place for players to celebrate major moments throughout the games with their fans.
According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.Twitter has an Earnings ESP of -2.06% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Why Covid Has Boosted M&A.,"Text size  It’s Merger Monday—and donuts are hot.  Dunkin’ Brands is in talks to be acquired by privately held Inspire Brands, which is offering to pay $106.50, or a 20% premium, for the donut maker. Dunkin’ stock is at $105 in premarket trading.  The 20% threshold is fairly common in deal-making. It doesn’t reflect a detailed valuation of the company being acquired, but seems to be the price required to pry shares away from existing shareholders.  Newsletter Sign-up The Barron s Daily A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron s and MarketWatch writers. PREVIEW  At $106.50, Dunkin’ is valued at about 35 times estimated 2021 earnings, a 60% premium to where shares have traded over the past few years.  The Dunkin’ deal shows again that, surprisingly, Covid-19 hasn’t damped M&A. Over the past three months, roughly 118 deals have been announced worth almost $570 billion. Last year, over the same span, about 88 deals worth $334 billion were announced.  Clearly, the Covid-19 recession isn’t a typical slowdown. There’s no credit or banking crisis, which means it’s not a Wall Street problem—it’s a Main Street problem. Higher unemployment and cash flow issues fall on regular Americans. And ultralow interest rates are like steroids for M&A.  With rates set to stay low, expect merger activity to remain hot.  —Al Root  *** Hear conversations on 5G with AT&T, a look at IPOs, SPACs and direct listings with Renaissance Capital, and the evolution of retail with Stitch Fix at Barron’s Investing in Tech Conference this Thursday at 1 p.m. EDT.

For example, Alphabet stock has risen 10% since the subcommittee’s report, despite the subsequent DOJ lawsuit.

The Turkish president’s latest attack was ostensibly over the policy Macron recently unveiled to fight the influence of “radical Islam,” and his warning, after a teacher was decapitated in the street on October 16, that France would never “give up on cartoons” and the freedom to publish them.  What’s Next: Macron’s stance on the freedom to criticize and caricature religions including Islam is also creating an uproar in many Muslim countries.

73,2020-10-26,08:00:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-steps-cloud-gaming-another-120004496.html,Facebook steps into cloud gaming -- and another feud with Apple,"Facebook  will soon be the latest tech giant to enter the world of cloud gaming. Their approach is different than what Microsoft  or Google has built, but Facebook highlights a shared central challenge: dealing with Apple.
Facebook is not building a console gaming competitor to compete with Stadia or xCloud;  instead, the focus is wholly on mobile games. Why cloud stream mobile games that your device is already capable of running locally? Facebook is aiming to get users into games more quickly and put less friction between a user seeing an advertisement for a game and actually playing it themselves. Users can quickly tap into the title without downloading anything, and if they eventually opt to download the title from a mobile app store, they ll be able to pick up where they left off.
Facebook s service will launch on the desktop web and Android,  but not iOS due to what Facebook frames as usability restrictions outlined in Apple s App Store terms and conditions.
With the new platform, users will be able to start playing mobile games directly from Facebook ads. Image via Facebook.
While Apple has suffered an onslaught of criticism in 2020 from developers of major apps like Spotify,  Tinder and Fortnite for how much money they take as a cut from revenues of apps downloaded from the App Store, the plights of companies aiming to build cloud gaming platforms have been more nuanced and are tied to how those platforms are fundamentally allowed to operate on Apple devices.
Apple was initially slow to provide a path forward for cloud gaming apps from Google  and Microsoft, which had previously been outlawed on the App Store. The iPhone maker recently updated its policies to allow these apps to exist, but in a more convoluted capacity than the platform makers had hoped, forcing them to first send users to the App Store before being able to cloud stream a gaming title on their platform.
Apple lays out its messy vision for how xCloud and Stadia will work with its App Store rules
For a user downloading a lengthy single-player console epic, the short pitstop is an inconvenience, but long-time Facebook gaming exec Jason Rubin  says that the stipulations are a non-starter for what Facebook s platform envisions, a way to start playing mobile games immediately without downloading anything.
""It s a sequence of hurdles that altogether make a bad consumer experience,"" Rubin tells TechCrunch.
Apple tells TechCrunch that they have continued to engage with Facebook on bringing its gaming efforts under its guidelines and that platforms can reach iOS by either submitting each individual game to the App Store for review or operating their service on Safari.
In terms of building the new platform onto the mobile web, Rubin says that without being able to point users of their iOS app to browser-based experiences, as current rules forbid, Facebook doesn t see pushing its billions of users to accessing the service primarily from a browser as a reasonable alternative. In a Zoom call, Rubin demonstrates how this could operate on iOS, with users tapping an advertisement inside the app and being redirected to a game experience in mobile Safari.
""But if I click on that, I can t go to the web. Apple says,  No, no, no, no, no, you can t do that,  "" Rubin tells us. ""Apple may say that it s a free and open web, but what you can actually build on that web is dictated by what they decide to put in their core functionality.""

Rubin, who co-founded the game development studio Naughty Dog in 1994 before it was acquired by Sony  in 2001, has been at Facebook since he joined Oculus months after its 2014 acquisition was announced. Rubin had previously been tasked with managing the games ecosystem for its virtual reality headsets; this year he was put in charge of the company s gaming initiatives across their core family of apps as the company s VP of Play.
Rubin, well familiar with game developer/platform skirmishes, was quick to distinguish the bone Facebook had to pick with Apple and complaints from those like Epic Games, which sued Apple this summer.
""I do want to put a pin in the fact that we re giving Google 30% [on Android]. The Apple issue is not about money,"" Rubin tells TechCrunch. ""We can talk about whether or not it s fair that Google takes that 30%. But we would be willing to give Apple the 30% right now, if they would just let consumers have the opportunity to do what we re offering here.""
Epic Games launches a campaign (and lawsuit) against Apple
Facebook is notably also taking a 30% cut of transaction within these games, even as Facebook s executive team has taken its own shots at Apple s steep revenue fee in the past, most recently criticizing how Apple s App Store model was hurting small businesses during the pandemic. This saga eventually led to Apple announcing that it would withhold its cut through the end of the year for ticket sales of small businesses hosting online events.
Apple s reticence to allow major gaming platforms a path toward independently serving up games to consumers underscores the significant portion of App Store revenues that could be eliminated by a consumer shift toward these cloud platforms. Apple earned around $50 billion from the App Store last year, CNBC estimates, and gaming has long been their most profitable vertical.
Though Facebook is framing this as an uphill battle against a major platform for the good of the gamer, this is hardly a battle between two underdogs. Facebook pulled in nearly $70 billion in ad revenues last year, and improving their offerings for mobile game studios could be a meaningful step toward increasing that number, something Apple s App Store rules threaten.
For the time being, Facebook is keeping this launch pretty conservative. There are just 5-10 titles that are going to be available at launch, Rubin says. Facebook is rolling out access to the new service, which is free, this week across a handful of states in America, including California, Texas, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware,  Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia and West Virginia. The hodge-podge nature of the geographic rollout is owed to the technical limitations of cloud-gaming -- people have to be close to data centers where the service has rolled out in order to have a usable experience. Facebook is aiming to scale to the rest of the U.S. in the coming months, they say."

Here are five things you must know for Monday, Oct. 26:  1. -- Stock Futures Slump Amid Virus Surge, Doubts on Aid Package  Stock futures on Monday were kicking off a week heavy with earnings from U.S. tech giants on the downside as coronavirus infections surged, stimulus negotiations remained at a stalemate and investors prepared for the presidential election just more than a week away.  Contracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 275 points, S&P 500 futures dropped 30 points and Nasdaq futures fell 79 points.  Stocks closed mostly higher Friday but the S&P 500 fell 0.5% for the week, its first weekly loss in four, after negotiations between the White House and House Democrats on more economic aid for the struggling U.S. economy didn t make much headway.  The Dow declined 1% for the week and the Nasdaq fell 1.1%.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday the House could pass a relief package this week but ""that s up to (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch (McConnell) as to whether it would happen in the Senate and go to the president s desk, which is our hope and prayer.""  Pelosi said she sent the White House a list of remaining concerns she had on Friday and hopes to have answers on Monday.  Meanwhile, coronavirus infections in the U.S. hit a single-day record of 85,000 on Saturday. Deaths in the U.S. have passed 225,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.  2. -- Twilio, NXP Semiconductors and Hasbro Report Earnings Monday  Earnings reports are expected Monday from NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) - Get Report, Twilio (TWLO) - Get Report and F5 Networks (FFIV) - Get Report.  Hasbro (HAS) - Get Report reported Monday third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.88 a share, beating analysts  estimates of $1.63.

There is no certainty that any agreement will be reached. Neither group will comment further unless and until a transaction is agreed,” company spokeswoman, Karen Raskopf, said in a statement released to TheStreet.  The deal could be revealed as early as Monday, according to The New York Times, which first reported on the potential deal.  Dunkin  will be taken private at $106.50 a share, according to the Times, which relied on information from two people familiar with the talks. Shares of Dunkin  closed Friday at $88.79 a share, and were jumping almost 17% in premarket trading Monday to $103.75.  Dunkin  Brands is the parent company of coffee-and-doughnuts chain Dunkin’ and ice cream store Baskin-Robbins.  Inspire Brands owns Arby s, Buffalo Wild Wings and Jimmy John’s.  4. -- Google Pays Apple $8 Billion-$12 Billion Annually to Be Default Search Engine  Apple (AAPL) - Get Report receives an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion in annual payments - up from $1 billion a year in 2014 - in exchange for building Google’s search engine into its products, The New York Times reported.  The deal is just one aspect of the Justice Department s suit filed last week against Google, a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL) - Get Report. The alliance between the two tech giants is an example of what prosecutors said were Google s illegal tactics to protect its monopoly and choke off competition in web search, the Times noted.  U.S. Justice Department Files Formal Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google  Google s payments to Apple are probably the single biggest payment that Google makes to anyone and accounts for 14% to 21% of Apple’s annual profit, according to the Times.  Nearly half of Google’s search traffic now comes from Apple devices, according to the Justice Department, and the prospect of losing the Apple agreement has been described as a “code red” scenario inside the company. A former Google executive told the Times the prospect of losing Apple’s traffic was “terrifying” to the search giant.  5. -- China to Impose Sanctions on Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon  China said it would impose unspecified sanctions on the defense unit of Boeing (BA) - Get Report, Lockheed Martin (LMT) - Get Report, and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) - Get Report after the U.S. approved $1.8 billion in arms sales to Taiwan last week, Bloomberg reported.  The sanctions will be imposed “in order to uphold national interests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters Monday in Beijing. Boeing s ""Boeing Defense” division would be among those sanctioned, he said.  Boeing has “worked together successfully with the aviation community in China for almost 50 years to support Chinese efforts to ensure a safe, efficient and profitable aviation system to keep pace with the country’s rapid economic growth,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg.  “It’s been a partnership with long-term benefits and one that Boeing remains committed to,” the spokesperson added.  Boeing shares fell 1.82% to $164.32 in premarket trading."

It s a pivotal week for the stock market rally. Hopes for a pre-election stimulus deal are fading. It s the heart of earnings season, with Apple stock, and Microsoft (MSFT) among those reporting.  X  The market rally suffered further losses last week, but the major indexes and leading stocks found support and pared losses.  Wall Street is heading into the peak week of earnings. Along with Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft stock, Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), AMD (AMD), Shopify (SHOP), Twilio (TWLO), ServiceNow (NOW) among the hundreds of companies reporting. It s the last full week before the presidential election. New coronavirus cases are breaking records in the U.S. and Europe, but Covid vaccine news could come any day. And stimulus deal hopes and doubts remain.  All of this is taking place with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq at key levels. The major indexes and many leaders, such as Microsoft stock, Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Tesla (TSLA), could offer buying opportunities with a good day or two. But one or two bad sessions could trigger serious concerns about the stock market rally.  Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks  Leaderboard Stocks  Tesla, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce stock are all on IBD Leaderboard.  Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe stock also are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Unlike Apple and Amazon stock, which are not Long-Term Leaders, these three software giants are all holding above their 10-week moving averages. The 10-week line is a good place to buy Long-Term Leaders, but investors should wait to see a little more strength in these stocks, as well as the market rally. Microsoft earnings also loom.  Meanwhile, Tesla stock also has found support near its 10-week line, with buy points or sell signals not far away. It s hard to believe it, but the Tesla news cycle might quiet down for a time.  The Latest IBD/TIPP Trump Vs. Biden Tracking Poll  Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures fell 1.15% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.95%.  Along with the surge in coronavirus cases, stalled stimulus deal talks also could influence Dow Jones futures. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday blamed President Trump for the lack of a stimulus deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been stimulus deal talks with Pelosi, said the White House has offered compromises but the Speaker is ""dug in.""  The House is already out while the Senate will leave town on Monday, after the likely confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. While Congress could be called back to vote on a stimulus deal, that seems unlikely with election campaigns in the final stretch.  Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 GOP senator, said Sunday that he hopes a stimulus deal can be passed after the election.  Meanwhile, German software giant SAP (SAP) on Sunday cut its full-year revenue and operating profit forecasts, saying the coronavirus pandemic will hurt demand ""at least"" through mid-2021. SAP did beat Q3 profit views, though revenue missed.  SAP stock plunged roughly 20% in premarket trading.

Daily coronavirus cases worldwide are approaching half a million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.16 million.  Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 8.88 million, with deaths above 230,000.  Vice President Mike Pence s chief of staff Marc Short and political adviser Marty Obst have tested positive for the coronavirus. NBC News reported at two more Pence aides have tested positive for the coronavirus, while ABC News said a total of five people in the vice president s ""orbit"" have tested positive.  Pence, who has tested negative again, has decided not to quarantine and will continue campaigning.  The U.S. added 81,210 new coronavirus cases on Friday, a new daily record, followed by 79,449 on Saturday. That s partly due to increased testing from earlier in the year, but positive test results are rising sharply as well. Coronavirus restrictions have eased from earlier in the year, but the biggest factor may be Americans weary of following social distancing and mask rules.  Several European countries have been hitting daily records, with Spain and France now with more than one million Covid-19 cases in total. Much of Europe has reimposed tougher coronavirus restrictions, but not much in U.S. cities and states so far.  If coronavirus restrictions are reimposed, that could stall a relatively solid economic recovery. That would likely add pressure for a new stimulus deal.  Coronavirus death rates remain relatively low, reflecting better treatments and procedures and the lag between infection and fatalities. Hospitalizations for the coronavirus have risen sharply, however.  Coronavirus Vaccine News Soon?  Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) and partner BioNTech (BNTX) could release interim effectiveness data on their coronavirus vaccine candidate from final-stage trials any day, with a possible FDA approval request by late November. Moderna (MRNA) could follow a few weeks later.  In a best-case scenario, millions of coronavirus vaccine doses will be out before year-end, targeting those most at risk. But it would still take many months to vaccinate most Americans.  Both Pfizer and Moderna report earnings this coming week.  The AstraZeneca (AZN) Covid-19 vaccine reportedly produces a robust antibody and T-cell immune response in elderly people. The U.S. part of AstraZeneca s final-stage trial finally resumed Friday following a severe reaction by one participant.  A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine also has resumed late-stage trials after a brief pause over a participant s illness. The J&J Covid-19 vaccine candidate is one of the few that would require just a single dose.  Stock Market Rally Last Week  U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 28336.62 -27.04 -0.10 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3465.59 +12.10 +0.35 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 11548.28 +42.28 +0.37 Russell 2000 (IWM) 162.98 +0.85 +0.52 IBD 50 (FFTY) 38.33 +0.30 +0.79 Last Update: 4:04 PM ET 10/23/2020  The stock market rally continued to slide, though the major indexes all found support at their 21-day exponential moving averages.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9% in last week s stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite slid 1.1%, but held its ground after tumbling 1.65% on Monday.  Apple stock fell 3.3%, closing near weekly lows. Amazon sank 2.1%. Microsoft sank 1.6%, but has now risen for the past four sessions. Salesforce retreated 3.1%. Adobe fell back 2.85%, but rallied Friday to get just above its 10-week line. Tesla stock sank 4.3%.  Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 2.7%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) lost 1.3%, with Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe all major components. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 1.4%.  Long-Term Leaders Near Buy Points  A good time to buy Long-Term Leaders is near their 10-week moving averages. Dow Jones stocks Microsoft and Salesforce rebounded from their 10-week lines this week, while Adobe reclaims that key level Friday.  But you want to see these stocks decisively break short trend lines in their handles, with similar action in the major indexes. But if these stocks are moving decisively higher, the Nasdaq likely will show positive action as well.  In the case of Dow Jones giant Microsoft, investors should wait until after its Tuesday night earnings.  Microsoft and Adobe fell about 1% early Monday. Salesforce stock lost nearly 2%.  Tesla Stock  After trying to break past an early entry on Oct. 14, Tesla stock has retreated, undercutting its 50-day and 10-week line on Friday but closing above those line.  Especially n a weekly chart, TSLA stock looks fine. It s been consolidating relatively tightly over the past several weeks and is once again finding support at the 10-week line. It s also forged a handle with a 466 buy point. Aggressive investors could use 445.33, just above Thursday s intraday high, as an early entry.  On the other hand, if Tesla decisively breaks below its 10-week line, investors may want to consider paring gains.  Over the last couple of months, there were several expected catalysts for Tesla stock: S&P 500 inclusion, Battery Day, Q3 deliveries and Q3 earnings. S&P inclusion hasn t happened while the other there events didn t drive TSLA stock higher. Then again, they haven t sunk the stock either.  Tesla stock fell 2% early Monday.  Tesla News About To Get Boring?  No, that s not a reference to Tesla sister company Boring.  In the next few weeks, the Tesla news cycle may actually quiet down. Sure, there is plenty going on. Tesla is exporting Model 3 cars from its Shanghai plant to Europe, taking over somewhat for the Fremont, Calif., plant.  In a new SEC filing Monday, Tesla said it expects capital spending in 2020 to be at the high end of its target range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. Capex already picked up in Q3. It sees capex of $4.5 billion to $6 billion in 2021 and 2022.  Tesla could cut the Model 3 prices in the U.S. in the coming weeks, after recently slashing Model 3 prices in China and cutting Model S prices.  No doubt, Elon Musk and Tesla will keep themselves in the public eye. The Full Self Driving beta launch is getting a lot of attention, with Tesla raising the FSD price to $10,000 on Monday even as critics note the Level 2 system s shortcomings.  But on paper, Tesla has few key ""circle that date"" events over the last couple of months. The Model Y will soon launch in China, though perhaps not until the start of 2021. Meanwhile, the Ford Mustang Mach E, a Model Y competitor, will launch in the U.S. before year-even. The VW ID.4, another Model Y rival, will start global deliveries around the start of the year.  So all of those events, along with Tesla s Q4 deliveries, herald a new round of headlines and the beginning of a critical year for the electric car industry.  These 4 Stocks Are Trading Bullishly, Offering New Buy Points  Stock Market Analysis  Heading into last week, there were reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Sure, the major indexes had pulled back, a little, but that was allowing many tech giants to form handles.  Then on Monday, Oct. 19, the major indexes suffered sharp losses, with growth names harder hit. After a couple of modest days, stocks undercut their 21-day lines in Thursday s session, with the 50-day line not far past that. Thankfully, the major indexes rebounded for slim gains, followed by Friday s rally into the close.  Arguably, the stock market rally is a good day or two from looking bullish again. Breaking the short trend lines in the Nasdaq would be a positive sign. Then again, it would only take a day or two for the market rally to look bearish, testing or undercutting 50-day lines.  Dow Jones futures suggest that the major indexes will test or undercut their 21-day lines at Monday s open, with the Dow itself sinking to around its 50-day line.  Game Plan The Market Rally  Analyze your stocks. A lot of mixed action in growth names this week. You might have cut back your exposure but still grade your current holdings. Several of your stocks may have earnings due in the next few days. Do you have enough of a cushion heading into results?  Build up your watch lists. There are a lot of good-looking charts. Many just need one push, whether from individual earnings or broad market strength, to flash clear buying signals. So you want to be ready.  Let The Stock Market Trend Be Your Friend  But while the stock market rally hasn t done anything seriously wrong over the past two weeks, it hasn t been a good environment for making money.  Earnings season is usually enough chaos for your portfolio. But this headline-driven stock market rally has so headlines to deal with right now: the presidential election, coronavirus vaccine news, stimulus deal talks. Coronavirus cases are front-and-center once again. All could swing the market one way or the other in the next few weeks.  Don t get too exposed. Wait for the market to show clear positive direction. That could happen in the next few days or weeks. There will be many breakouts and other buying opportunities if the market takes off again. If market heads lower, new buys are likely to struggle.

More recently, Wall Street has turned its attention to the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. GOOGL that partly focuses on its relationship with Apple.
Despite the concerns, it is far from certain that the lawsuit will truly shake up Google or Apple. And of course, Google has said it will fight back against the lawsuit and the litigation could take years. It is also worth noting that Alphabet stock has climbed this week, which might tell investors something.
With this in mind, let’s dive into Apple ahead of the release of its fourth quarter fiscal 2020 financial results that are due out on Thursday, October 29 to help decide if it’s time to buy AAPL stock.
Quick Antitrust Overview 
Google relies heavily on search traffic from iPhones, where its flagship search engine is the current default on Apple’s Safari phone browser. The two tech giants don’t release the financial significance of this mutually beneficial relationship.
That said, reports project that Google pays Apple between $8 billion to $10 billion a year to be the default search engine on iOS devices. And the DOJ lawsuit projects that this partnership accounts for between 15% and 20% of Apple’s annual profits.
These are big numbers and the situation is worth monitoring closely. However, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon AMZN, and Facebook FB have all been under increased government scrutiny for years and it didn’t prevent any of their stocks from climbing to new highs. And their overall earnings outlook (also read: Previewing Big Tech Earnings).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Apple’s Growth...
Apple’s newest iPhone officially became available on Friday, October 23. The iPhone 12 is its first 5G-capable phone and it will be available in four models at various price points. The company priced its higher-end models roughly the same as last year’s iPhone 11, despite the new features and its 5G capabilities. The reasoning is somewhat clear: 5G is still in the early days and AT&T T and its peers still have miles to go before the next-generation wireless network reaches anything near what the current network does.
Therefore, the price-point helps entice consumers to buy the new iPhone despite what many tech analysts say are the somewhat standard updates to features such as the camera. The next-generation wireless network will play a key role in the future and the company is prepared to benefit from the transition, as it gets people excited now.
It’s also worth remembering that Apple is one of the best marketers in retail history, and it remains the world’s most valuable brand. The ability for a high-end consumer tech firm to lift its sales by 11% last quarter to $60 billion in the heart of a global pandemic and economic crisis is impressive. And analysts have said that the pre-order numbers for the iPhone 12 Pro have been strong across all markets.
Apple’s iPhone sales popped last quarter, and its Mac and iPad sales surged amid the remote work and schooling push. Its wearables unit, which includes its smartwatch and popular wireless headphones, also jumped over 17%, while services climbed 15%. This growth helps showcase how crucial expansion beyond the iPhone is. Apple now has revenue streams coming from its massive App store, and subscription services such as Spotify SPOT competitor Apple Music, its streaming TV service, news offering, video gaming, and more.
In fact, Apple’s paid subscriptions grew by more than 35 million sequentially to reach over 550 million paid subscriptions across its various services. And executives said on its earnings call that they remain confident it will hit its increased target of 600 million before the end of the 2020 calendar year.
What Else...
Apple closed the quarter with $81 billion in net cash and returned over $21 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. AAPL’s dividend yield rests at 0.72% right now. The income seems like an added bonus for a company that’s still expanding its portfolio, which includes bringing more of its chips in-house. The move is projected to help cut costs and improve battery life and performance.
Apple trades at 6.4X forward 12-month sales. This marks only a slight premium to its industry and represents a solid discount to Microsoft’s MSFT 10.2X, as it has for years. AAPL stock has climbed roughly 90% in the past year and over 60% in the last six months. Despite its strong performance, the stock hovers around 12% off its early September highs, which clearly gives it room to run.
AAPL stock soared after it announced its 4-for-1 stock split. The cosmetic move, which Apple has done before, was made to help make its shares more attractive and attainable to a wider array of investors. The stock closed regular trading Friday at $115 per share, while Amazon trades at $3,200 and GOOGL comes in at $1,600.
Outlook
The pandemic forced Apple to push back the release of its next-generation iPhone. This saw it launch in October and not late September, which will likely boost its Q1 fiscal 2021 sales and hinder its upcoming fourth quarter results.
The success of its services and wearables divisions help make up for the seasonality of its flagship device. With this in mind, our current Zacks estimates call for Apple’s adjusted Q4 earnings to dip 9.2% on 0.51% lower revenue. Nonetheless, Apple’s FY20 EPS figure is projected to climb 9% on 5% stronger sales that would see it hit $273 billion.
Apple’s fiscal 2021 revenue is then projected to jump 15.4% above our current-year estimate to reach $315 billion, with its adjusted earnings expected to come in 24% higher. The company has topped our bottom-line estimates by an average of 16% over the last four periods, including a 27% beat last quarter. And the nearby chart shows that its earnings estimates have trended slightly higher.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bottom Line
Apple is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that rocks an “A” grade for Momentum and a “B” for Growth heading into its upcoming earnings release. Clearly, the near-term remains uncertain and some likely want to wait to see how its results shake out and perhaps hold off until after the election before buying stocks in general.
That said, those with a longer-term outlook of a year or more might want to consider buying Apple at a 12% discount because people are addicted to their iPhones, apps and technology as a whole. And remember that Apple pays a dividend, buys back a ton of stock, and has loads of cash that will help it venture into whatever new areas might be next.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Monday as investors fretted about the rising number of coronavirus cases and the potential for new containment measures to derail the economic rebound.
At 8 AM ET (1200 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 33 points, or 1%, lower, the Dow Futures contract fell 284 points, or 1%, while Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 90 points, or 0.8%.
Weighing heavily on investors’ confidence has been the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the northern hemisphere as cooler weather starts to arrive. In Europe, France reported a record daily rise over the weekend, while Italy has ordered bars to close early and Spain has issued a nationwide curfew.
The news in the U.S. isn t much better, with the country seeing its highest ever number of new Covid-19 cases in the past two days, even affecting some aides of Vice President Mike Pence. Hospitalizations are also rising and deaths are trending upwards, yet White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CNN that ""we aren t going to control the pandemic.""
Yet, despite this news, a new coronavirus relief package seems very unlikely to happen before next week’s presidential election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Meadows accused each other of “moving the goalposts” in negotiations over the weekend, suggesting there still is too large a gap between the two sides for a compromise to be reached promptly.
This will be the busiest week of the earnings season so far, with almost 170 S&P 500 companies set to report. The major focus is likely to be on the big tech names, with Microsoft  reporting Tuesday and Apple , Facebook , Alphabet , Amazon  and Twitter  all reporting after the closing bell on Thursday.
Looking at economic data, the main release Monday will be the September new home sales number, with the housing market still showing strong growth. However, the week’s major release will be the preliminary estimate of third-quarter GDP on Thursday, which is expected to see a record rebound of 31.9% after a historic 31.4% plunge in the second quarter.
Oil prices slumped Monday, weighed by the rise in coronavirus cases in the U.S. and Europe, traditionally two of the largest energy consuming regions in the world.
Oil traders will also be keeping an eye on the progress of tropical storm Zeta, as it’s poised to turn into a hurricane and disrupt oil production in the Gulf of Mexico.
U.S. crude futures traded 2.3% lower at $38.93 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.1% to $41.20. Brent fell 2.7% last week and WTI dropped 2.5%, their first weekly losses in three.
Elsewhere, gold futures was flat at $1,905.40/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.1822.

78,2020-10-26,01:20:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-holds-crazy-misguided-view-052009773.html,"Apple Holds 'Crazy, Misguided View' About Owning All Commerce Related To iPhone, Says Epic Founder","Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney castigated Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) over antitrust concerns in the ongoing dispute over the removal of the former s ""Fortnite"" game from the App Store.
What Happened: “Apple’s position is that they seem to truly believe they  own  all commerce involving phones they make, characterizing direct payment as theft, smuggling, and even shoplifting,” Sweeney said in a tweet on Sunday. “It’s a crazy, misguided view.”
Sweeney s comments came in the aftermath of Epic’s latest legal response to the Cupertino-based tech giant as reported by The Verge.
As per a filing Apple filed in a court in the Northern District of California, the Tim Cook-led company is claiming damages on grounds that Epic violated its iOS App Store contract.
The tech giant said in its complaint that the North Carolina-based game-maker was the beneficiary of unjust enrichment and also claimed the latter interfered in a tortious manner between Apple and its customers.
Epic said in its own legal response that its actions were “a far cry from the tortious—even purportedly criminal—conduct that Apple’s Opposition depicts.”
The game maker said Apple is making an “extraordinary assertion” by claiming that its collection of payments from the players of its own game is “”taking of something that belongs to Apple.”
Why It Matters: Earlier in the month, a judge refused to issue a permanent injunction that would have allowed Fortnite to be reinstated on Apple’s App Store, The Verge reported separately. 
In August, Epic had secured interim relief that prevented the Cupertino-based company from terminating developer accounts, including the latter’s “Unreal Engine” platform, according to Bloomberg. 
The legal troubles between the tech giant and Epic stem from a dispute regarding a 30% cut Apple takes on in-app payments, which the game-maker deems unjust.
Price Action: Apple shares closed nearly 0.6% lower at $115.04 on Friday.
