With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels.

The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months.

The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure...

1,2020-10-27,00:30:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-succession-plans-complicated-lee-043031609.html,Samsung Succession Plans Complicated by Lees Risk of Jail Time,"(Bloomberg) -- Jay Y. Lee has been groomed for decades to take over Samsung Group, the conglomerate founded by his grandfather and built by his father into a technology giant. Yet even after the death of Lee Kun-hee on Sunday, his only son will likely have to wait a bit longer for his ascension.

The younger Lee is in the midst of two trials over allegations he used bribery and accounting trickery to smooth his succession. While he has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, Lee faces the possibility of returning to jail if he is convicted. Samsung may hold off on naming Lee to his father’s role as chairman of Samsung Electronics Co. at least until the first trial is completed in the coming months, avoiding a scenario where the newly minted chairman goes to prison.

That means Samsung would operate without a chairman for at least a few more months, a lack of clear leadership that could hurt many companies. But Samsung Electronics has respected executives who run the key operations, and Lee already holds the title of vice chairman to make broader, strategic decisions as needed.

“I think Jay Y. Lee will be promoted to chairman early next year,” said Lee Sang-hun, analyst at HI Investment & Securities. “He might also wait until the bribery case is finalized.”

Samsung declined to comment. The company hasn’t said who will take over the chairman position or when.

The timing of Lee’s formal ascension is sensitive given how public dissatisfaction with the country’s powerful conglomerates, or chaebols, has grown in past years. That backlash stems in part from the high-profile allegations of graft against Lee, which triggered the impeachment of then-President Park Geun-hye.

Also complicating the succession is an enormous inheritance tax bill the Lee family will have to pay, possibly loosening their control over the conglomerate. The elder Lee had an estimated fortune of $20.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and could owe about $10 billion because of the country’s high rates.

Story continues

Samsung Heirs Owe Billions in Taxes. Here’s How They Might Pay

Most families choose to pay such taxes in cash rather than in stock to maintain control, said Chung Sun-sup, chief executive officer of Seoul-based corporate-analysis firm Chaebul.com. They can take five years to make the payments, he said.

There’s little doubt the 52-year-old Lee will succeed his father eventually. The younger Lee, who is trilingual, studied at Japan’s Keio University and Harvard Business School after receiving an undergraduate degree from Seoul National University, the nation’s top school. He has brought a more global approach to Samsung’s management, forging relationships with key partners like the late Steve Jobs.

While Samsung Electronics is best known globally for its smartphones and appliances, it makes most of its money by supplying companies like Apple Inc. with components such as memory chips and panels.

Chang Sea-Jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore Business School, said the alternatives to simply promoting Lee may be worse. Naming an interim chairman from the Samsung executive ranks, for example, would complicate decision making by adding an extra management layer, he said. There would be valuable clarity in Lee taking on his father’s role, he said.

“I think he should take the chairmanship now,” said Chang. “Whatever the circumstances, he has to make the decisions.”

Samsung can’t afford to drift. The company faces renewed challenges from Apple and the rise of tough Chinese competitors in smartphones, along with chronic pricing difficulties in memory chips. Samsung is also embarking on expensive initiatives in fifth-generation wireless technology and the semiconductor foundry industry. Samsung Electronics reports results Thursday.

Samsung Low-Profile Heir Poised to Succeed Father Seen as a God

Chang pointed out that Lee wouldn’t have to run individual business units because of the professional managers who steer the operations. That’s a marked contrast to the early days of his father’s tenure, when the elder Lee got deeply involved in key divisions.

“He doesn’t have to be another Lee Kun-hee; they have much stronger professional management,” Chang said. “He should be a different kind of chairman than his father.”

Lee’s legal troubles could drag on for years. A retrial of bribery and corruption allegations will unfold this year, with a decision likely early next year. A newer case about alleged accounting wrongdoing will get under way again in January and will likely take months.

Such prosecutions don’t carry the same kind of stigma in South Korea as they do in many other countries. Lee Kun-hee was convicted twice -- and pardoned twice. The chairman of SK Group was also jailed in 2013, then returned to his company in 2016 where he remains at the helm.

Chang joked that prison is almost like “graduate school” for the country’s business leaders.

“Eventually we should move away from this environment in South Korea and have the same standards as other countries,” he said.

The fund takes a conservative approach to its investments, including using hedging and risk management strategies to achieve its desired risk-adjusted returns. The fund’s assets under management more than doubled between early-2017 and early-2018, and topped $542 million in the middle of 2020.

The surge in AUM is somewhat surprising given the Brasada Long-Short Equity Fund’s lukewarm returns. 2019 was one of the fund’s better years, as returns hit 12.99%. The preceding four years were a lost cause, with losses in 2018 and 2015 slightly outpacing the single-digit gains posted in 2016 and 2017. Overall, the fund’s compound annual return was 1.92% through the first quarter of 2020.

Let’s check out some of the biggest moves made by Brasada Capital Management in Q2, which included taking much bigger stakes in Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Stocks Bought by Brasada Capital in Q2

Danaher Corporation

Hedge funds have never been more bullish on Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), with ownership of the stock rising by over 50% in the last 18 months among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Brasada made a much bigger commitment to the stock during Q2, more than tripling the amount of DHR shares it owns. Danaher shares are having an impressive 2020, gaining over 50% for the second-straight year on the strength of strong results like double-digit revenue growth in Q3.

Apple

Brasada Capital also added to its Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) position, hiking it by 43% to nearly 15,000 shares. Apple is now several years removed from being hedge funds’ favorite stock, though it did rank among the 11 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About in 2020 Q2 and ownership of the tech giant has risen by over 20% in the last year among the funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Preorders for Apple’s iPhone 12 have been very strong despite the line’s aggressive pricing, more than doubling what the iPhone 11 models generated. With Apple’s shares up by over 50% in 2020, it will need to deliver stellar results like that for the stock to avoid a holiday slump.

Prologis

Brasada Capital more than doubled the size of its Prologis Inc (NYSE:PLD) position in Q2, taking a much bigger stake in the industrial REIT and supply chain logistics company, which manages the flow of more than $2 trillion in goods annually. Brasada Capital isn’t the only hedge fund to have a growing interest in PLD, as ownership of the stock among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey has jumped by 40% over the past year, during which time Prologis has continued to boost income at a strong rate while maintaining a rock-solid balance sheet.

Amazon

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was another tech giant that Brasada Capital bought more shares of during Q2, boosting the size of its Amazon holding by 82%. Amazon is far and away the most popular stock among hedge funds, with 30.1% of the funds tracked by Insider Monkey being Amazon shareholders. Amazon’s annual Prime Day event, which was pushed back from July until October this year due to the pandemic, shattered sales records, pulling in $3.5 billion during the two-day event, a 60% year-over-year increase.

WEC Energy

Brasada Capital opened a new position in WEC Energy Group, Inc. (NYSE:WEC) during the second quarter, one of many funds to buy into the stock in 2020, as ownership of it doubled during the first-half of the year among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey’s database. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Paul Tudor Jones’ Tudor Investment are among the prominent funds to buy WEC this year. Shares of WEC have trended upward throughout the second-half of the year, gaining over 16%. WEC Energy took an 85% stake in the under construction Tatanka Ridge Wind Farm earlier this year and is well positioned for similar future acquisitions.

With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%.

7,2020-10-26,18:00:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5g-much-better-not-due-220017381.html,"Your 5G Is About to Get Much Better, and Not Due to the New iPhone","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Apple Inc. has finally joined the 5G party, and it’s a well-timed entrance.

Often derided for being late to new technologies, and rightly so, the launch of its first 5G iPhones coincides with some important changes to be rolled out by the telecoms industry this quarter. As a result, wireless connections are going to get better and smartphone performance should improve.

Release 16 of the 3GPP standards, also known as 5G Phase 2, is mostly focused on technologies that will benefit non-smartphone applications, including vehicle communications, factory connectivity and internet of things. (Release 15 marked the first set of 5th-generation mobile telecom specifications). The details were finalized in June — frozen, in industry parlance — and will be rolled out by year end. While the standards are global, countries, operators and vendors may implement them at different times.

Yet owners of Apple’s $999 iPhone 12 Pro along with consumers who have the Galaxy S20 5G from Samsung Electronics Inc. ($999) or the Mate 40Pro from Huawei Technologies Co. ($1,400)(1) can also expect to see some upside.

And it’s not a minute too soon. As my colleague Tae Kim pointed out recently, the lackluster current state of 5G networks “could lead to underwhelming demand.”

One of the biggest complaints about 5G handsets is that they’re power hogs, a fact acknowledged by Samsung. An update contained in Release 16 addresses this by offering a power-saving technique called DRX adaptation. DRX stands for discontinuous reception and has been used in 4G systems, with the new specifications now making a version available for 5G radio standards. This feature allows the smartphone and the network to coordinate so that the device can enter a kind of sleep mode for signal reception.

With a few other techniques also added to the line-up (for geeks, they are: cross-slot scheduling, maximum MIMO layer adaptation, and fast transition out of connected state), smartphones should be able to last longer before requiring a recharge.

Story continues

Much of the hype surrounding 5G speeds relates to the use of new high-frequency bandwidths more commonly known as mmWave; the wavelengths are literally 1 millimeter. But the problem is that it’s subject to all sorts of environmental factors — a heavy rainstorm could reduce speeds to a trickle — and crazy small footprints that could make coverage range even worse than WiFi.

This requires operators to roll out more base stations and place them closer together. But doing so also requires more connections to the core network — known as backhaul. Normally this is done via some sort of cable, eg, fiber optic.

Release 16, however, supports integrated access and backhaul, meaning that telecom operators can add mmWave base stations without the need to run a cable to the cell site, though it will still need electricity. Instead, they can use wireless frequencies to provide both consumer access and network backhaul, which should cut both the time and cost of rolling out more stations and help boost coverage.

A collection of other additions, each seemingly minor, will also improve the way smartphones move between existing Long-Term Evolution (4G) networks and the new 5G systems. While there’s a lot of expectation surrounding the faster 5G networks, the reality is that operators and smartphones will generally be switching between the old and the new. If done well, consumers will barely notice the difference in speeds and reliability. But to make it happen seamlessly, Release 16 offers enhancements that will make the transition between the networks more efficient.

As these new specifications trickle through the industry, from handset and equipment vendors to telecom operators, consumers can expect to see their fancy new 5G handsets start to approach the speeds they’re paying for.

The stock market rally suffered heavy losses amid soaring coronavirus cases and a big tech warning. The major indexes broke key support, at least intraday, and leading stocks suffered significant chart damage but rallied somewhat into the news on stimulus deal news.

X

Twilio (TWLO), Chegg (CHGG) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) reported earnings after the close. Dexcom (DXCM) reported revenue a day early and announced the retirement of a key executive.

The major indexes started Monday with modest losses and initially improved, but soon reversed sharply lower. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq all fell through their 50-day moving averages, though the latter closed slightly above that key level due to stimulus-deal buzz.

German software maker SAP (SAP) plunged 23% on its big warning, which hit several other software makers as well. But growth names were broadly lower as spiking coronavirus cases finally took center stage on Wall Street, with Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Google stock all down about 3%.

Bucking the trend were Apple stock, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Amazon.com (AMZN), all ending with fractional gains.

Key Earnings Late Monday

Twilio earnings topped views, but the communications software maker guided to a wider Q4 loss. Twilio stock, which closed just out of buy range, fell 1.5% overnight. Online education player Chegg beat views and guided up for Q4 and 2021. Chegg stock fell 5% in extended trade after momentarily topping a buy point Monday morning.

NXP Semiconductors reported a smaller-than-expected Q3 loss and topped on revenue after giving strong preliminary revenue figures earlier this month. The automotive and wireless-chip maker also guided higher for Q4 revenue. NXP stock rose 3% in extended trade after pulling back Monday; it's still in range from a flat-base buy point.

Dexcom reported stronger-than-expected revenue but said Chief Commercial Officer Rick Doubleday, who oversaw sales, marketing and customer service, will retire at the end of the year. Dexcom stock tumbled 6% overnight after recently regaining its 50-day line. The maker of diabetes products will release its full earnings report late Tuesday as scheduled.

Microsoft, AMD Earnings Kick Off Tech Giants

After Monday's sell-off, it's even more important that leading stocks and especially tech giants deliver strong results. Microsoft and AMD stock are on tap late Tuesday, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com, Facebook, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and many more slated for Thursday night.

When Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Amazon and Google stock (all with more than $1 trillion market caps) move, they can move markets. Facebook stock isn't far off at $787 billion. AMD has ""only"" a $96 billion market cap, but its results also likely influence data-center peers Nvidia (NVDA), Monolithic Power (MPWR) and Inphi (IPHI), with the latter two also reporting this week. Apple earnings and guidance could influence iPhone chipmakers, while Microsoft may provide a shot in the arm — or the gut — for software makers after the SAP (SAP) meltdown.

Stimulus-Deal Buzz

Stimulus-deal buzz helped buoy stocks late in the session. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stimulus-deal talks continued Monday. Pelosi said the only real issue left is an agreement on testing and tracing language, but that's been the main sticking point on a stimulus deal for quite some time.

The odds of a pre-election stimulus deal seem next to nil at this point. The Senate is due to leave town for the final week of election campaigning, with the House already out. Then again, with Election Day so close, a post-election coronavirus aid package may not be so negative.

Once the election is out of the way, a Pelosi-Mnuchin stimulus deal could come relatively soon. However, Senate Republicans are reluctant to support such a hefty price tag.

Microsoft stock is on IBD Leaderboard and IBD Long-Term Leaders. Amazon stock, AMD, Microsoft and Chegg are on the IBD 50.

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced a fraction. Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.

Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks

Coronavirus News

Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 43.77 million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.16 million.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 8.96 million, with deaths above 231,000.

Dow Jones giant Pfizer (PFE) and Novavax (NVAX), which have both started late-stage coronavirus vaccine trials, report earnings early Tuesday. Pfizer and partner BioNTech (BNTX) could provide initial data on their Covid-19 vaccine candidate any day, with a possible FDA approval request by late November.

Stock Market Rally Monday

U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 27686.04 -649.53 -2.29 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3401.05 -64.34 -1.86 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 11358.94 -189.34 -1.64 Russell 2000 (IWM) 159.56 -3.51 -2.15 IBD 50 (FFTY) 37.48 -0.85 -2.22 Last Update: 4:14 PM ET 10/26/2020

The stock market rally suffered serious losses, though the major indexes closed off their worst levels, especially the Nasdaq.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 2.3% in Monday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index fell 1.9%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.6%. While the Nasdaq closed above its 50-day line, the Nasdaq 100 did not.

Surging coronavirus cases in the U.S. and Europe understandably took a toll on airlines, hotels and ""real economy"" stocks broadly. But the SAP warning also showed that software and other tech names also could come under pressure from the resurgent coronavirus pandemic.

Microsoft fell 2.8%, knifing through its 50-day line. Facebook sank 2.7% and Google lost 3% but are still somewhat above their 50-day lines.

Apple stock managed to close up 1 cent, Amazon up 0.1% and AMD 0.3%, though only the latter managed to close back above its 50-day. While all three stocks have handles, Apple's and AMD's are flawed because their midpoints are below the midpoints of their bases.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 2.2%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) lost 2.5%, with Microsoft stock a major holding. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) pulled back 2.1%, even with AMD stock providing a fractional boost.

Stock Market Rally Analysis

Monday's sell-off came after the major indexes and many top stocks had already pulled back to many support levels. There wasn't much room left before the stock market rally would start to show serious weakness.

The heavy losses also put in context how modest Friday's 0.4% Nasdaq bounce was.

The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all broke below their 21-day exponential moving averages and straight through their 50-day lines. All the major indexes have fallen back below their September highs, which had served as short-term highs. The Dow Jones fell under the low of its Sept. 30 follow-through day, a negative sign.

Could the stock market rally rebound over the next few days or weeks? Absolutely. Perhaps Monday's sell-off will mark the end of a shakeout, though that case could have been made several times in the past two weeks.

Earnings reports, coronavirus vaccine news and election results all could buoy the major indexes and leading stocks. But those hypothetical tailwinds could end up being headwinds. Or a mix of major positive and negative crosswinds roil the markets and your psyche.

One or two strong market days would be a relief, but would not necessarily signal a bright green light to ramp up exposure. But one or two bad days would make the major indexes look bad, with more failed breakouts or broken charts.

What To Do Now

In this environment, investors should be cautious. Your exposure likely will be coming down as you take profits on round-tripping holdings or cut losses. Meanwhile, there are few good options for starting new positions right now. But keep updating your watchlists. If the market rally revs higher, many leading stocks will quickly offer buy points.

But as the past two weeks have shown, when the stock market rally pulls back, it's hard to make money.

With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

Fears about soaring coronavirus infection rates around the world and uncertainty over the presidential election next Tuesday left market participants struggling to figure out which way stocks should move, and that left gravity to impose itself. The Nasdaq closed with a loss of 1.6%.

As difficult as it is to see the stock market fall, there are a lot of positives that are providing some support to the market. Today, Dunkin' Brands International (NASDAQ:DNKN) joined the growing group of companies that are considering strategic moves in order to bolster their businesses. Also helping to keep the Nasdaq from losing more ground were two stocks that have always had a major impact on the Nasdaq and promise to continue to do so well into the future.

An Inspire-ing deal for Dunkin'?

Dunkin' Brands saw its stock soar 16% on Monday. The doughnut and coffee chain became the latest target of a privately held company that's made some high-profile acquisitions in the restaurant space on several occasions in recent years.

In a strangely vague press release, Dunkin' revealed in its ""statement about possible acquisition"" that Inspire Brands has held preliminary discussions with the doughnut maker. It took third-party reports to learn possible details, including a price of $106.50 per share that would value Dunkin' at roughly $8.8 billion.

Inspire is a holding company that owns a number of other restaurant concepts. Previously known as Arby's Restaurant Group, Inspire purchased Buffalo Wild Wings and Sonic Drive-In in 2018 and then followed that up with the acquisition of sandwich maker Jimmy John's in 2019.

The deal shifts the focus away from Dunkin's earnings report, scheduled for Thursday. Some speculate that if the reports prove accurate, a Dunkin' acquisition could lead the private equity community to look more closely at mergers and acquisitions in the restaurant space.

The big names in the Nasdaq

Playing a more important role in keeping the Nasdaq's losses in check were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Neither stock made huge gains on Monday, but their recovery into the green by the end of the day signaled that investors haven't yet given up on the Nasdaq to make an end-of-year push toward record highs.

Apple is also scheduled to release its latest financial report on Thursday, and investors are anxious to see how the iPhone maker will fare going into the key holiday season. There's been a lot of focus recently on the new iPhone 12 line, which takes advantage of the new 5G capabilities that are starting to emerge among wireless carriers. Many have hoped that the 5G rollout would inspire a big new wave of upgrades among users who've until now been reticent to pony up for a pricey new smartphone.

Meanwhile, Amazon's shareholders have Thursday marked on their calendars as well to see how the e-commerce giant is doing financially. With the annual Amazon Prime event having just occurred, those following the stock hope Amazon will say something about how it fared. Moreover, because the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed many companies to accelerate their digital transformation efforts, some expect Amazon's Web Services division to post heightened growth rates.

As interesting as deals like a Dunkin' acquisition can be, it's far more important to the health of the Nasdaq's bull market for Amazon and Apple to thrive. Without them, the stock market could quickly reverse course and bring what's been an amazing recovery to an end."
12,2020-10-26,16:20:00,AAPL,https://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-stock-forms-cup-with-handle-base-q4-earnings/?src=A00220,Apple Might Skip Holiday-Quarter Guidance With Earnings Report,"When Apple (AAPL) reports September-quarter results on Thursday, the consumer electronics giant might continue its recent pattern of not giving current-quarter guidance, a Wall Street analyst said. Apple stock ended Monday nearly unchanged.

X

In a note to clients Monday, Deutsche Bank analyst Jeriel Ong said Apple could be reluctant to give December-quarter guidance because of the late launch of the iPhone 12 series handsets. Apple typically releases its latest iPhones in September. But the iPhone 12 didn't go on sale until Oct. 23.

""With only a week of new iPhone sales by the time earnings are reported on Oct. 29, we are unsure that Apple will feel comfortable with guidance,"" Ong said. ""They have not guided officially since January, and for the December quarter, they typically have 1.5 months of new iPhone sales data prior to guidance, a luxury they don't have for this iPhone cycle.""

Ong kept his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 140.

Apple Stock Has Formed Cup-With-Handle Base

On the stock market today, Apple stock rose a penny to 115.05.

Apple stock has formed a cup-with-handle base with a buy point of 125.49. But in a negative sign, shares are trading below their 50-day moving average line.

The new base is part of a larger, eight-week consolidation with a buy point of 138.08, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.

Apple Earnings Seen Sliding 7%

Ong expects Apple to post ""solid"" September-quarter results. The work-from-home and learn-from-home trends spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to boost Mac and iPad sales, he said.

Wall Street expects Apple to earn 71 cents a share on sales of $64.16 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. In the year-earlier period, Apple earned 76 cents a share on sales of $64.04 billion. That would translate to a year-over-year decline of 7% in earnings on flat sales.

For the December quarter, analysts are modeling Apple earnings of $1.36 a share, up 9%, on sales of $100.22 billion, up 13%.

Apple Stock Added To 'Tactical Outperform' List

Cowen analyst Krish Sankar on Monday reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 133.

He said Apple management on Thursday ""could give color"" on the December quarter ""without providing formal guidance again given the ongoing pandemic.""

Meanwhile, Evercore ISI added Apple stock to its Tactical Outperform stock list. Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani maintained his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 135.

Apple should benefit from a trifecta of the iPhone 12 upgrade supercycle, accelerating services growth and strength in non-iPhone hardware demand, Daryanani said in his report to clients.

Amazon. com is set up to beat Street estimates for both the September and December quarters, J.P Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth asserts in a research note Monday.

The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant (ticker: AMZN) will report earnings after the close of trading on Thursday alongside reports from Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Street consensus calls for Amazon to report third-quarter revenue of $92.5 billion and profits of $7.25 a share. For the December quarter, the Street expects $111.4 billion and $8.87 a share."

Services revenue is expected to rise, but at a slower pace compared to past quarters.

COVID-19 may cause declining revenue after strong growth in Q3 FY 2020.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) posted record financial results in its most recent quarter, Q3 FY 2020, as the company benefitted from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for many of its products surged amid the growth of the work-from-home economy.﻿﻿

Investors will be watching to see if Apple can maintain that growth when it reports earnings on October 29, 2020 for Q4 FY 2020.﻿﻿ The company's fiscal year ended in September. Analysts expect year-over-year (YOY) declines in both earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, marking the first drops since fiscal 2019.﻿﻿

Investors also will focus on a key metric in the Q4 results: the iPhone maker's services revenue. Apple has long been known for its hardware products, such as smartphones and computers. But it's aggressively diversifying by expanding revenue from services, thus reducing its dependence on hardware sales.﻿﻿ Analysts expect Apple to report healthy growth in services revenue YOY.﻿﻿

Apple's success this year has been reflected in its stock, which has outperformed the broader market. Apple shares have provided a total return of 91.1% over the past 12 months, well above the S&P 500's total return of 15.3%, as of October 23, 2020.

Source: TradingView.

The stock jumped after the company posted record quarterly results that beat analysts' expectations in Q3 FY 2020.﻿﻿ EPS rose a robust 18.4% YOY, the second-fastest pace of growth in the past seven quarters. Revenue grew 10.9%, marking the fastest pace since Q4 FY 2018.﻿﻿

The growth was broad based across the company's geographic segments and in both products and services.﻿﻿ It was also a definite improvement from the more modest EPS growth of 3.8% and anemic revenue growth of 0.5% posted in Q2 FY 2020.﻿﻿ After Apple's July 30 earnings report, the stock advanced until early September. Since then the stock has drifted downward and sideways.

Analysts are currently forecasting a slump in revenue and earnings in Q4 FY 2020. EPS is expected to decline 9.3% YOY, the largest drop since Q2 FY 2019. Revenue is expected to fall 1.1%, the first decline since Q2 FY 2019. For full-year 2020, analysts expect EPS and revenue to rise 8.5% and 4.9%, respectively, an improvement from the annual declines posted for both numbers in FY 2019.﻿﻿"

Stocks declined sharply Monday to kick off a week heavy with earnings from U.S. tech giants as coronavirus infections surge, stimulus negotiations remain at a stalemate and investors prepare for the presidential election more than a week away.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 776 points, or 2.74%, to 27,558, the S&P 500 tumbled 2.27% and the Nasdaq slumped 2.18%.

TheStreet's Katherine Ross discussed breaking news in the stock market. Cramer spoke about his expectations from Apple and Twitter's stock after it reports earnings and Dunkin's potential sale to Inspire Brands.

Apple: Buy Or Sell?

Apple (AAPL) - Get Report is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and analysts expect the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant to post earnings of 71 cents a share on revenue of $64.16 billion.

Cramer said to buy Apple after it reports earnings. ""There is an expectation from the bulls today that Tim Cook is going to give very positive guidance. And if you were in Tim Cook's shoes it makes no sense to do so.""

Twitter: Buy Or Sell?

Twitter (TWTR) - Get Report reports its earnings later this week. Twitter was attacked by President Trump over the way it handled a recent article from the New York Post. That didn't help the stock. Shares of the tech giant continue to waver, but overall the trend still looks favorable for the social media stock.

Cramer said Twitter might be a speculative buy because it's not FAANG. ""The last quarter for Twitter was very good but Twitter has been uneven. Its stock has moved significantly and if this trend is for real then Twitter might be worth picking up in what I consider an abysmal morning where people are selling everything.""

Dunkin's Potential Sale to Inspire Brands

Dunkin is looking at a potential $9 billion sale to Inspire Brands, which is listed as a portfolio holding of Roark Capital. “Dunkin’ Brands confirms that it has held preliminary discussions to be acquired by Inspire Brands. There is no certainty that any agreement will be reached. Neither group will comment further unless and until a transaction is agreed,” company spokeswoman, Karen Raskopf, said in a statement released to TheStreet on Sunday.

Cramer said there is a recognition about the mom and pop coffee shop which for many people has always been a mainstay. ""Those of us who love coffee are willing to go to Dunkin like Starbucks but also like the local coffee store. The local coffee store doesn't have the capital to be able to handle this downturn. The coffee shops are so thinly capitalized that if I were Dunkin which definitely needs more space to expand, it's getting it.""

18,2020-10-26,14:47:00,AAPL,https://www.investopedia.com/best-dividend-stocks-4774650?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral,Best Dividend Stocks for November 2020,"For decades, income-minded investors have searched for the best dividend stocks out there. In my experience, the main criteria to look for when betting on great dividend stocks include a history of strong fundamentals, increasing dividend distributions over time, great entry points (technicals), and a history of bullish trading activity in the shares.

The hallmark way I go about finding the best dividend stocks – the outliers – is by looking for quiet unusual trading activity. Oftentimes, that can be institutional activity – i.e. big money. I'll go over what that unusual trading activity looks like in a bit. But the five stocks I see as long-term dividend growth candidates are Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY), Walmart Inc. (WMT), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD), Apple Inc. (AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT).

Over decades, I've learned that the true tell on great stocks is that big money consistently finds its way into the best companies out there – especially dividend-paying stocks. Some of the biggest returns ever have come from holding stocks for many years and reinvesting dividends. I am a very long-term minded person and see dividend investing as a pillar in personal finance and financial independence.

I take a well-rounded approach and rank each stock by technicals (long-term), fundamentals (long-term), and if there is big money supporting the stock. I want the odds on my side when looking for the highest-quality dividend stocks … and I own many of them. Many times, when a stock is under pressure, it's worthy of inspection. As stock prices head lower, the dividend yield increases. That is important for dividend seekers.

Up first is Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY), which is a leading pharmaceutical company that is consistently growing and raising its dividend. When deciding on a strong candidate for long-term dividend growth, I like to look for stocks showing near-term muted performance:

One-month performance: +1.46%

Historical big money buy signals

Just to show you graphically how I like to look at stocks, below are the big money signals Bristol-Myers has made the last year. Green bars are showing that Bristol-Myers stock was likely being bought by an institution according to MAPsignals, while red bars indicate selling. Recently, there has been some red. Buying on dips can offer higher yields to a dividend investor.

www.mapsignals.com; end-of-day data sourced from Tiingo.com

On top of technicals, when deciding on the best dividend stock, you should look under the hood to see if the fundamental picture supports a long-term investment. As you can see, Bristol-Myers Squibb has a strong dividend history:

Three-year dividend growth rate: +3.2%

Current dividend per share: $0.45

Forward yield: 2.99%

Three-year earnings growth rate: +63.88%

Next up is Walmart Inc. (WMT), which is a leading superstore chain. Walmart has a long dividend history, and shares have been in an uptrend recently. When deciding on a strong candidate for long-term dividend growth, it's a good idea to look for many years of dividend increases. Let's look at Walmart's recent performance:

With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

20,2020-10-26,13:56:00,AAPL,https://www.barrons.com/articles/apple-reports-its-earnings-thursday-heres-what-to-expect-51603734974?siteid=yhoof2,Apple Reports Its Earnings on Thursday. Analysts Are Already Getting Jazzed.,"Text size

The September quarter may seem like the corporate equivalent of a lame duck for Apple, as the final quarter without any contribution to earnings from the newly unveiled iPhone 12 lineup. Investors are focused on demand for the new phones, but the results may still yield some surprises.



Wall Street is busily tweaking its numbers, resulting in a flurry of Monday research notes, before the figures come out late on Thursday. The consensus forecast is for revenue of $64.2 billion and per-share profits of 71 cents.

Atlantic Equities analyst Ianjit Bhatti on Monday assumed coverage of Apple (ticker:AAPL) from one of his colleagues, lifting the firm’s rating to Overweight from Underweight, and setting a price target of $150. At the heart of his call is the idea that it would be a mistake to value Apple like just another tech company.

“Having created an enduring premium consumer electronics brand, we believe that Apple’s product business should be valued in line with other premium and luxury consumer stocks, rather than traditional computer peers,” Bhatti writes. “Apple’s focus on delivering superior user experiences through design, enabled by its unsurpassed silicon to software design capabilities, has resulted in a premium product positioning, differentiating Apple against computing peers.”

Citi’s Jim Suva sees potential upside to consensus estimates driven by iPads, Macs and Wearables, saying “work from home and stay at home trends continued to drive [an] uptick in consumer tech spending during the quarter.” He sees a promising hint in a recent strong earnings report from the peripherals company Logitech (LOGI), which said that iPad accessories were up 144% in the quarter. Suva maintains a Buy rating on the stock and a target of $125 for the share price.

Meanwhile, Cowen’s Krish Sankar repeats his Outperform rating and $133 price target. He thinks September quarter results will be in line with Street estimates, driven by strong demand for iPads and Macs. For the December quarter, he sees sales up 48% sequentially and 5% year over year, with iPhone unit sales hitting 70 million.

“Apple remains one of out top ideas in the hardware space,” he writes.

Raymond James analyst Chris Caso, who has an Outperform rating on the stock, reports that lead times for the iPhone 12 as of Friday had stretched out to 2-3 weeks in all markets other than the U.S., where the phone was available for same-day or next-day pick up in most parts of the country. He echoes other analysts in finding that the iPhone 12 Pro is in tighter supply than the base iPhone 12, noting that Pro models are not available for in-store pickup in the US at this time.

“This is generally consistent with prior launches, where inventories of the higher-end devices are generally lower than the mass market tier,” he writes.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryananai also repeats his Outperform rating and $135 price target, while adding a “tactical outperform” element to his call. He says the stock “should keep working higher,” driven by strong demand for hardware other than iPhones, acceleration in the services business, and strong iPhone 12 demand, driven in part by aggressive promotions offered by wireless carriers in the U.S. Apple’s commentary about the December quarter will be more positive than the Street expects when the company reports results on Thursday, he says.

RBC Capital’s Robert Muller also had a bullish note on Apple on Monday, discussing the results of a survey of more than 800 Apple and Android users on their buying intentions.

“We believe the results bode well for Apple’s newly released 5G enabled phones, which we expect will kick off a multi-year upgrade cycle,” he writes. “iPhone users appear quite sticky with 90% of iPhone customers either ‘definitely’ or ‘likely’ to remain in the ecosystem. This compares to just 71% of Android customers. Further, 24% of Android customers are considering an iPhone for this cycle, with 16% considering a switch to a 5G model. The Apple ecosystem remains strong with the average iPhone user owning 1.9 additional Apple products.”

He kept an Outperform rating and $132 price target on Apple shares.

Apple shares held their ground on Monday afternoon, slipping 0.5% to $114.48, while the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%.

The wireless earbuds have become an important growth engine for Apple and have been a hit with users since they debuted in late 2016.

The company is working on the second generation of the high-end AirPods Pro, as well as the third iteration of the original, entry level AirPods, according to the report, citing people familiar with the plans.

This could mark a major redesign for the popular device, with a shorter stem for the AirPods, while potentially eliminating it altogether on the AirPods Pro. Apple is also testing a more rounded design that better fills the user's ear.

As sales of its flagship iPhone have slowed, Apple has increasingly turned to its other products and services to generate growth. Wearables, which include AirPods, Apple Watch, and Beats products, have been an area of increasing importance for the company, growing significantly faster than any other area of Apple's business. In fact, as the overall wearables market has taken off, Apple's share has grown even faster.

During the second quarter, the market for wearable devices grew 14% year over year, according to industry watcher International Data. At the same time, Apple's wearable shipments grew 25%, as the company continued to gain market share, which grew to 34%, up from 31% in the prior-year quarter."

Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

The U.S. recorded a record number of confirmed cases on Friday, with many states driving the increase. On top of the COVID-19 surge, a stimulus bill getting signed before the election is looking less likely as the days tick away without an agreement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was down about 2.4% at 11:45 a.m. EDT on Monday.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was down less than the market on Monday following some analyst optimism regarding the iPhone 12 and the company's vast services business. Other stocks in the Dow exposed to a worsening pandemic didn't fare as well.

Apple tapped to outperform

Expectations of strong demand for non-iPhone products, an acceleration of the services segment, and a big upgrade cycle for the iPhone 12 have led analysts at Evercore to put Apple stock on its ""tactical outperform"" list. Evercore also maintained its outperform rating and its $135 price target.

Evercore sees the potential for Apple's fiscal 2021 results to outpace analyst expectations, driven by a higher average selling price for iPhones, new service offerings, and solid sales of Macs and iPads. The iPhone 12 family raises the base price from the iPhone 11 family, although a slightly cheaper iPhone 12 Mini will become an option in November.

Evercore does concede that results for the next couple of quarters may not impress. For the quarter ending in September, a lack of new iPhone models and the availability of the budget-priced iPhone SE could drag down iPhone sales. For the quarter ending in December, Evercore is worried about Apple's gross margins.

The company is launching new iPhones into a U.S. economy that has been both ravaged by the pandemic and propped up by the $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in March. That stimulus bill, which sent checks to Americans and added a weekly $600 supplement to unemployment payments, almost certainly contributed to Apple's strong results during the pandemic.

With a winter wave of COVID-19 looking like a certainty, a lack of new stimulus could make Apple's pricey new iPhones a tough sell for consumers over the next few months. An iPhone 12 supercycle is possible, but it's far from guaranteed.

Shares of the tech giant were down about 0.7% by late Monday morning. Apple stock is still up roughly 56% so far this year.

Stocks drop on COVID-19 exposure

Every Dow stock was in the red just before lunch time on Monday as cases of COVID-19 surge across the country. Notable losses include a 4% decline for American Express (NYSE:AXP), a 3.7% decline for Boeing (NYSE:BA), and a 3.1% decline for Disney (NYSE:DIS).

American Express depends on travel and entertainment spending, both of which have been gutted by the pandemic. The credit card giant reported a 20% sales decline for its third quarter last Friday, and the company maintained a cautious outlook. With the pandemic surging in the U.S. and Europe, American Express may be in for a tough winter.

Boeing is in a similar situation. Demand for air travel has plummeted due to the pandemic, and a record-setting wave of the virus this winter won't help. Daily passenger traffic through airport security checkpoints is still down around 60%; a full recovery could take years if the economy is slow to rebound. Airline bankruptcies could further roil the industry, although additional airline bailouts are a possibility.

Disney still hasn't reopened its Disneyland resort in California, although Disney World in Florida has been open since July. A third wave of the coronavirus will make reopening difficult in the coming months, and there's no guarantee that Disney World will remain open if the pandemic gets bad enough. Disney is doubling down on streaming to make up for lost revenue elsewhere, but it will be tough going for the iconic company, at least for the next few months.

The market is starting to worry about the pandemic again, punishing stocks exposed to renewed stay-at-home orders. There will eventually be a light at the end of the tunnel, but right now the winter is looking bleak for many pandemic-exposed stocks."

Apple (AAPL) - Get Report plans to update its AirPods earbuds, releasing two new models next year, according to a media report.

The Cupertino, Calif., technology giant will remodel its third-generation entry-level AirPods to have a shorter stem, replaceable ear tips, and a possibly improved battery life, Bloomberg reported.

Apple will also launch AirPods Pro earbuds, which will be more compact and smaller in size because the short stem at the bottom will be eliminated.

The current model being tested includes a more rounded shape that fills more of a user’s ear and has a design similar to models from Samsung, Amazon (AMZN) - Get Report, and Google (GOOGL) - Get Report, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.

Apple also plans to launch new wireless chips to power both models.

The company faced challenges integrating noise-cancellation, wireless antennas, and microphones into a smaller AirPods casing, which could result in a less perfect design when the product is finalized, Bloomberg reported.

AirPods have gained in popularity since they were launched in 2016. They were most recently updated in March 2019. AirPods Pro was released last October.

The company’s wearables, home and accessories division, which includes AirPods, posted $6.5 billion in revenue in the last quarter, increasing around 70% from 2018.

Earlier this month, Apple launched several new products, including the long-awaited 5G-capable iPhone 12.

Apple unveiled four different iPhone models, including the iPhone 12 mini, a 5.4-inch model starting at $699; a 6.1-inch device starting at $799, a 6.1-inch Pro model starting at $999, and a 6.7-inch pro model starting at $1,099.

At last check Apple shares were trading up 0.3% at $115.34."

At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

Here's a sample of Wall Street's commentary.

Apple (AAPL) - Get Report is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and analysts expect the Cupertino, Calif., tech giant to report earnings of 71 cents a share on revenue of $64.16 billion.

Apple shares were at last check were 0.7% higher at $115.88.

Here is what Wall Street is saying about Apple ahead of its earnings release.

Deutsche Bank (Reiterates Buy Rating, $140 PT)

We expect a solid Sept-quarter report from AAPL, but see investors overlooking any recent strength/weakness and focusing on the December quarter given the recent iPhone release and impact on guidance and the March quarter beyond, as this is the first time that all new iPhone products are a month or more delayed.

Long term we continue to believe that AAPL is the best name to own in the IT hardware landscape, outweighing our worries regarding the large year-to-date rise and subsequent valuation expansion.

- Jeriel Ong

JPMorgan (Reiterates Overweight Rating, $150 PT)

Relative to the near term, we envision limited near-term upside on iPhone volume estimates. [But we] would not rule out upside in the upcoming quarter through sustained tailwinds from work-from-home/e-learning trends as well as wearables sales; although, in entirety still only driving modest upside relative to recent quarters.

With regard to implications on the 5G cycle from the upcoming print, the focus will be on guidance, which we forecast to track above expectations despite understandable cautiousness driven by the limited visibility into sales velocity for the yet to launch iPhone 12 Pro Max and 12 mini.

-Samik Chatterjee

RBC Capital (Reiterates Outperform Rating, $132 PT)

In our inaugural edition, we surveyed over 800 Apple and Android (GOOGL) - Get Report users in the U.S. regarding their device usage and buying intentions. We believe the results bode well for AAPL's newly released 5Genabled phones, which we expect will kick off a multiyear upgrade cycle. Fitness+ interest also exceeded our expectations and we view the service as a potentially underappreciated piece of the story.

With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share.

It's the documentary about whistleblower Edward Snowden blowing his whistle. I saw it right after its 2014 release. Whether you feel Snowden is a hero or a traitor isn't at issue here – the issue is that big brother is alive, well, and certainly stronger than it was in 2014.

The government, along with the world's largest companies, watch, listen, monitor, record, and archive every electronic interaction you have with the outside world. Or worse: your inside world. Snowden's point was to educate global citizens that their privacy was both compromised and exploited.

Think about it – all of your ""free"" or even paid services make you the currency. Free email services like Gmail, AOL, or Yahoo archive your every conversation. Every internet search tied to your IP address is logged. Think of the worst thing you ever searched – it's out there forever.

As is everything you've ever said or looked at on Facebook, Inc. (FB) and its Instagram platform, Snap Inc. (SNAP), etc. In addition, Siri on your Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone is always listening, along with Amazon.com, Inc's (AMZN) Alexa, Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google Home Assistant, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.'s (SSNLF) Bixby.

Your location, purchasing habits, and commuting times are all stored. At home, you're watched by computer webcams. And who uses cash anymore? Every time you swipe your credit card or use Apple Pay or a similar service, it just adds to your profile.

There exists a digital fingerprint representation of you that is so detailed and accurate, all someone needs is to get a well-studied lookalike to replace you. This is what Snowden realized and decided to go public with. The truly scary part is that everyone has become so reliant on modern ease-of-life. So, when the whistle blew, the aftermath was short-lived and didn’t result in any major government change.

It's like that funny scene in ""Ghostbusters"" when Louis is hunted by the dog-like beast outside Tavern on the Green. He screams in horror for help. The diners stop in silence, watch him get attacked, and then after two seconds return to their conversations as if nothing happened.

We are the same. Why? Because we all know it's happening and say: ""I have nothing to hide."" We quietly accept that the tradeoff for convenience is our freedom of privacy. But imagine life without all this convenience! ""It's not worth it, and I couldn't get off the grid even if I tried. And I'm such a small actor in this huge play – there's nothing I can do.""

That's the level of chilling insight I got working Wall Street's biggest stock deals in the early 2000s. The big boys run the show, and even my actions as a professional were a drop in the ocean.

Then, I realized that the power lay in tracking the big money. I didn't have to know who or even where they were. I just had to try and track and record their moves. That's when the idea of stalking silent big money began. If I could see what the masses couldn't, I could flip the odds from against me to for me.

I started in 2002 and never looked back. I wanted to give the disadvantaged average investor like me the upper hand by being able to surf the big money that really drives markets. I felt I could predict with a degree of accuracy which stocks would rise. All because I did something even better than becoming a big money player: I figured out a way to watch all of them safely from afar. It's like I created stock market night vision goggles.

The single broadest gauge born out of this is the Big Money Index. It tells us when aggregate big money is buying or selling. That information is immensely powerful. Looking at a Big Money Index chart, it's clear: big money investors often know and act ahead of market moves. Not because they know before (which is true), but they often dictate the moves by their actions:

​www.mapsignals.com

Notice that, in January, big money buying slowed and reversed. Stocks kept rising until February, when the reality of coronavirus set in. Big money began selling a full month earlier. Then, in March, the market became deeply oversold. We were sending in the marines to buy great stocks. Big money rocketed and lifted the entire market with it.

Then in September, stocks began to sag consistent with pre-election risk-off. But look how the Big Money Index began falling slowly from July and then accelerated its drop in late August. (We just completed a white paper on the Big Money Index.)

Let's face the hard truth: the big forces will always have the upper hand. Big corporations, governments, and money will always use their natural advantage. So, the natural conclusion is: ""Who am I to do anything about it?""

But there is something you can do about it: flip the script. If you wanted to get off the grid, you could use encrypted email, delete your Facebook account, and strictly use cash. Impractical as it may be, it's possible.

But prevailing at stocks may be much easier. You could simply reveal the big money movements – provided you know how. It all has to do with understanding your place. Big money accounts need investors and traders to buy from and more importantly sell to. If you're not watching the big money, odds are that you're the one they need.

Stocks are like free services akin to Facebook, Gmail, Google, etc. How are they all free? If you can't figure out what the product is, you're the product.

The Bottom Line

We (MAPsignals) are bullish on high-quality U.S. equities in the long term, and we see market pullbacks as areas to pick up great companies.

34,2020-10-26,09:47:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-fb-report-q3-earnings-134701698.html,Facebook (FB) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,"Facebook FB is set to report third-quarter 2020 results on Oct 29.



For the quarter, Facebook expects DAUs and MAUs to be flat or slightly down in most of its regions, sequentially.



Further, the company expects ad-revenue growth on a year-over-year basis to be roughly 10%. Facebook assumes some of the recent surge in community engagement to normalize as regions reopen.



Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $19.81 billion, indicating an increase of 12.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.



Additionally, the consensus mark for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.93 per share, having been revised 0.5% upward in the past 30 days, but indicating a 9% decline from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.



Notably, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the trailing four quarters while beating the same in the other three, the average surprise being 9.1%.

Facebook, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Let’s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.

Advertiser Exodus to Hurt Ad Sales

Facebook witnessed jump in the usage of its services like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp in the second quarter amid growing incidence of the coronavirus pandemic. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter MAUs worldwide is pegged at 2.701 billion, suggesting 10.3% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, DAUs worldwide is pegged at 1.786 billion, indicating 10% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.



Nevertheless, ad sales for the to-be-reported quarter are expected to take a hit from advertiser exodus despite improving ad-spending environment as reflected by Snap’s SNAP recently announced third-quarter results. (Read More: SNAP Q3 Earnings Beat Estimates, User Growth Aids Top Line)



Notably, a number of companies, including Starbucks, Coca Cola and Verizon, among others, have announced plans to freeze ad spending on Facebook due to its failure to eradicate hate speech and misinformation.



Moreover, changes made by Apple AAPL and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google in their mobile operating systems and browser platforms have limited Facebook’s ability to track user-activity trend.



These factors are expected to have hurt Facebook’s advertising-revenue growth in third-quarter 2020.



Nonetheless, the company’s solid user base in the Asia Pacific region and growth in Instagram Stories and Feed are expected to reflect on the top line.



The consensus mark for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s third-quarter advertising revenues is pegged at $19.43 billion, indicating 11.7% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Key Q3 Developments

Facebook announced Instagram Reels that helps users to create and discover short, entertaining videos on Instagram.



Facebook also launched a feature called paid online events that enables businesses, creators, educators and media publishers to set up paid events or classes online and keep 100% revenues — except on Apple’s iOS, where event hosts must give up the 30% App Store tax.



Moreover, Facebook launched Facebook Campus, a college-only platform designed to help students connect with fellow classmates over shared interests.



Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also announced that the social media platform would not accept new political ads during the week before the election. The company would also remove posts that claim that people would get COVID-19 if they take part in voting.



Moreover, Facebook introduced a forwarding limit on Messenger which allowed messages to be forwarded to five people or groups at a time.



The company also announced that users can now transfer Facebook photos and videos directly to two additional services - Dropbox and Koofr - using its latest data-portability tool.



Additionally, Facebook renamed its AR/VR team as Facebook Reality Labs. The team works on several products including Oculus, Portal and Spark AR.



Further, Facebook introduced Quest 2, its next-generation VR device starting at $299. The device started shipping from Oct 13.



Facebook also announced a multi-year partnership with Ray Ban-parent EssilorLuxottica. The two companies, in collaboration, will release a pair of Ray Ban-branded smart glasses in 2021.



The company also unveiled Project Aria that will help Facebook develop the first generation of wearable augmented-reality devices.



Moreover, Facebook announced partnerships with BlueJeans, GoToMeeting, Webex and Zoom Video to offer even more video-conferencing apps to Portal users. These apps will be available on Portal Mini, Portal and Portal+ in September, with plans to add support for Portal TV in the future.



Facebook announced that it would no longer show health groups in recommendations. However, people can still invite friends to health groups or search for them.



Facebook also introduced Facebook Business Suite that allows businesses to post to Facebook and Instagram at the same time, and manage and receive messages, notifications and alerts in one place.

(NASDAQ: AAPL), the first U.S. company to hit the -trillion market cap landmark, is scheduled to report its fiscal year 2020 fourth-quarter results Thursday, Oct. 29, after the market close.

Q4 Expectations For Apple: Analysts, on average, estimate Apple to report earnings per share of 71 cents on revenue of $64.16 billion, according to the Yahoo database.

This compares to EPS of 76 cents and revenue of $64.04 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty estimates EPS of 62 cents and revenues of $60 billion, with iPhone and Services revenues comprising $22.9 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively.

The consensus estimate, which bakes in iPhone revenue of $28.5 billion — assuming 40.4 million shipments and an average selling price of $705 — is too high, the analyst said.

New products typically account for about 47% of iPhone revenue in the fourth quarter, and the just-concluded fourth quarter lacked any new product, she said.

Investors are likely to brush aside the September quarter iPhone results, given the focus on the iPhone 12, Huberty said.

Optimism On Apple's Future: For the December quarter, the Street is modeling EPS of $1.36 on revenue of $100.22 billion.

""The iPhone 12 launch has become a subscription battleground for carriers, as they are all offering sizable promotions to keep or add new customers. We feel these promotions will drive iPhone 12 demand over the next several months,"" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar said in a note.

The analyst raised his iPhone unit estimates for the December quarter by about 8 million units to 73 million units, translating to iPhone revenue of $62.8 billion.

The upside relative to the consensus iPhone revenue estimate of $59.9 million is primarily driven by the firm's carrier subsidy thesis, he said.

Morgan Stanley continues to see upside to both fiscal year 2021 and longer-term EPS estimate for Apple.

Higher lead times — the time between ordering and receiving a device — over a multi-month period typically signal stronger-than-expected iPhone shipment growth over the cycle, Morgan Stanley's Huberty said.

The initial data points for the iPhone 12 cycle are trending positively, the analyst said.

As of Oct. 20, average lead times are 18.5 days for the iPhone 12 Pro and 10.1 days for the iPhone 12, she said.

""That ranks the iPhone 12 Pro third behind the iPhone X and iPhone 11 Pro/Pro Max at this point in the cycle, and ranks the iPhone 12 just behind the iPhone 11 but ahead of the iPhone 8/8 Plus.""

Morgan Stanley would buy any dip in Apple shares after the Oct. 29 quarterly report on the basis of iPhone 12 strength and positive earnings revisions on the horizon, Huberty said.

AAPL Stock: Apple shares added about 27% during the calendar year third quarter and are up a steeper 60% year-to-date.

Morgan Stanley rates Apple shares with an Outperform and$136 price target.

Piper Sandler reiterated an Overweight rating and increased the price target from $130 to $135.

At last check, Apple shares were slipping 0.8% to $115.94.

With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

37,2020-10-26,09:11:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-twtr-report-q3-earnings-131101690.html,Twitter (TWTR) to Report Q3 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,"Twitter TWTR is set to report third-quarter 2020 results on Oct 29.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $765.3 million, indicating a decline of 7.1% from the year-ago quarter reported figure.



Meanwhile, the consensus mark for third-quarter earnings has increased 20% over the past 30 days to 6 cents per share. The company had reported earnings of 17 cents in the year-ago quarter.



The social media company did not provide its third-quarter 2020 revenue and operating income guidance due to the pervasive impact of coronavirus anxiety on advertiser demand.



Notably, the company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 1716.4%.

Twitter, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Twitter, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

Twitter, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Twitter, Inc. Quote

Let’s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.

Factors to Consider

Twitter’s ad revenues are expected to have taken a hit since small businesses that primarily use social media platforms are likely to have curbed ad spending as a contingent measure to cope with the coronavirus-led crisis.



The Zacks Consensus Estimate for advertising revenues is pegged at $632 million, indicating a decline of 10% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.



Though Twitter has become the go-to platform for news about coronavirus, some brands are hesitant to advertise alongside coronavirus discussions on social media platforms. Such companies are likely to have withdrawn ad contracts with Twitter in the to-be-reported quarter for fear of associating their brands with the sensitive topic.



Nonetheless, management at Twitter stated that total monetizable DAU (mDAU), which measures the number of users, has been benefiting from frequent discussions on the burning issue of coronavirus and an improving product experience.



In the second quarter of 2020, average mDAU was 186 million compared with 139 million in the year-ago quarter and 166 million in the previous quarter.



The company’s initiatives to prompt some users to click on links to other websites before retweeting them to stop the spread of misinformation and encourage more thoughtful communication are expected to have helped it expand the monetized user base in the to-be-reported quarter.



Twitter’s improved ability to proactively identify and remove abusive content from the platform has been a notable development in this regard.



Moreover, the company’s updated policies to ban political ads ahead of the presidential election in the United States on Nov 3 are expected to have boosted trustworthiness of the platform.



Further, steady demand for video ad products like Video Website Cards and in-stream pre-roll is likely to have contributed to the top line.

Story continues

Key Developments in Q3

During the quarter, Twitter and WebMD announced a partnership that will bring more WebMD content right to the Twitter feed with video content and Twitter Moments. This will help in educating consumers on health topics. It will also highlight patient stories on what it’s like to live with and manage chronic conditions and other health issues.



On Sep 8, Twitter, Bud Light and NFL unveiled Bud Light Showtime Cam that creates a dedicated place for players to celebrate major moments throughout the games with their fans.

What Our Model Says

According to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here.



Twitter has an Earnings ESP of -2.06% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Stocks to Consider

Here are a few companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:



Alphabet GOOGL has an Earnings ESP of +7.40% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2, currently. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.



Apple AAPL has an Earnings ESP of +2.97% and a Zacks Rank #3.



Shopify SHOP has an Earnings ESP of +23.02% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

It’s Merger Monday—and donuts are hot.

Dunkin’ Brands is in talks to be acquired by privately held Inspire Brands, which is offering to pay $106.50, or a 20% premium, for the donut maker. Dunkin’ stock is at $105 in premarket trading.

The 20% threshold is fairly common in deal-making. It doesn’t reflect a detailed valuation of the company being acquired, but seems to be the price required to pry shares away from existing shareholders.

Newsletter Sign-up The Barron's Daily A morning briefing on what you need to know in the day ahead, including exclusive commentary from Barron's and MarketWatch writers. PREVIEW

At $106.50, Dunkin’ is valued at about 35 times estimated 2021 earnings, a 60% premium to where shares have traded over the past few years.

The Dunkin’ deal shows again that, surprisingly, Covid-19 hasn’t damped M&A. Over the past three months, roughly 118 deals have been announced worth almost $570 billion. Last year, over the same span, about 88 deals worth $334 billion were announced.

Clearly, the Covid-19 recession isn’t a typical slowdown. There’s no credit or banking crisis, which means it’s not a Wall Street problem—it’s a Main Street problem. Higher unemployment and cash flow issues fall on regular Americans. And ultralow interest rates are like steroids for M&A.

Europe Tightens Restrictions in Desperate Race Against Covid-19 Second Wave

France became the European country worst hit by the coronavirus second spike, which hit the continent and the U.K. over the summer with unexpected intensity. The local and regional lockdowns proliferating in most countries threaten to hit the region with another devastating economic blow.

French authorities said on Sunday that more than 52,000 cases had been registered in the previous 24 hours, doubling from the previous week’s daily average. France now has the largest number of persons infected in Europe , and the fifth-largest in the world behind the U.S., India, Brazil and Russia.

What’s Next: Lockdown fatigue is triggering protests against the severity of the new measures, as the second spike of the virus is about to end the swift summer economic rebound. But the task of governments will become even harder if they cannot show rapidly results for the new restrictions—in the form of a major pandemic slowdown.

Pence Will Continue Campaign After Aides’ Positive Covid Tests

Vice President Mike Pence will continue a full campaign schedule after several of his aides, including his chief of staff Marc Short, tested positive for Covid-19. Both Pence and his wife Karen have tested negative.

The Pence team cases come as the U.S. reported a record of more than 80,000 new infections on both Friday and Saturday. “We’re not going to control the pandemic,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said Sunday. We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics.”

Barrett Set to Be Confirmed to Supreme Court Monday

Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court cleared a procedural vote to break a Democratic filibuster on Sunday, paving the way for a final confirmation vote Monday night.

The GOP got a late boost to Barrett’s nomination from Sen. Lisa Murkoski (R., Alaska). “While I oppose the process that led us to this point, I do not hold it against her, as an individual who has navigated the gauntlet with grace, skill and humility,” she said.

Big Tech Companies Report Third Quarter Earnings This Week

Investors will get a sense of how some of the biggest tech companies in the world fared during the third quarter when Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google’s parent company Alphabet, and Microsoft all report earnings this coming week.

All five tech mega caps have far outpaced the S&P 500

and politicians. The Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against Alphabet last week after the House antitrust subcommittee released a harsh report calling out Google and Facebook as monopolies. On Wednesday, the CEOs of Alphabet, Facebook, and Twitter legal protections afforded platform companies.

What’s Next: Investors have been relatively sanguine in response to growing scrutiny from Washington. For example, Alphabet stock has risen 10% since the subcommittee’s report, despite the subsequent DOJ lawsuit. As Barron’s Eric Savitz notes, these massive companies will likely emerge from the pandemic stronger—and more profitable—than ever.

France-Turkey Row at New Highs After Erdogan Suggests Macron Needs Mental Check

The French government said Sunday it would recall the country’s ambassador in Ankara after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insulted President Emmanuel Macron in a series of speeches, notably suggesting he needed “treatment on a mental level.”

The latest Erdogan attacks come after several months of rising tensions between the two countries, notably after France sent ships in the Mediterranean to oppose Turkey’s claims on natural gas reserves off Cyprus.

, and the two countries have taken opposite stances on regional wars in Syria or Libya, or the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Turkish president’s latest attack was ostensibly over the policy Macron recently unveiled to fight the influence of “radical Islam,” and his warning, after a teacher was decapitated in the street on October 16, that France would never “give up on cartoons” and the freedom to publish them.

What’s Next: Macron’s stance on the freedom to criticize and caricature religions including Islam is also creating an uproar in many Muslim countries. The French president may soon need more support on this—and on his confrontation with Turkey—from the rest of his EU partners, who have remained mostly silent for now.

Investors will get a sense of how some of the biggest tech companies in the world fared during the third quarter when Amazon. com, Apple, Facebook, Google’s parent company Alphabet, and Microsoft all report earnings this coming week.

All five tech mega caps have far outpaced the S&P 500 this year. Amazon (ticker: AMZN) and Apple’s (AAPL) performance year-to-date has been particularly noteworthy, with their shares gaining over 70% and just under 60%, respectively."
42,2020-10-26,08:00:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-steps-cloud-gaming-another-120004496.html,Facebook steps into cloud gaming -- and another feud with Apple,"Facebook will soon be the latest tech giant to enter the world of cloud gaming. Their approach is different than what Microsoft or Google has built, but Facebook highlights a shared central challenge: dealing with Apple.

Facebook is not building a console gaming competitor to compete with Stadia or xCloud; instead, the focus is wholly on mobile games. Why cloud stream mobile games that your device is already capable of running locally? Facebook is aiming to get users into games more quickly and put less friction between a user seeing an advertisement for a game and actually playing it themselves. Users can quickly tap into the title without downloading anything, and if they eventually opt to download the title from a mobile app store, they'll be able to pick up where they left off.

Facebook's service will launch on the desktop web and Android, but not iOS due to what Facebook frames as usability restrictions outlined in Apple's App Store terms and conditions.

With the new platform, users will be able to start playing mobile games directly from Facebook ads. Image via Facebook.

While Apple has suffered an onslaught of criticism in 2020 from developers of major apps like Spotify, Tinder and Fortnite for how much money they take as a cut from revenues of apps downloaded from the App Store, the plights of companies aiming to build cloud gaming platforms have been more nuanced and are tied to how those platforms are fundamentally allowed to operate on Apple devices.

Apple was initially slow to provide a path forward for cloud gaming apps from Google and Microsoft, which had previously been outlawed on the App Store. The iPhone maker recently updated its policies to allow these apps to exist, but in a more convoluted capacity than the platform makers had hoped, forcing them to first send users to the App Store before being able to cloud stream a gaming title on their platform.

Story continues

For a user downloading a lengthy single-player console epic, the short pitstop is an inconvenience, but long-time Facebook gaming exec Jason Rubin says that the stipulations are a non-starter for what Facebook's platform envisions, a way to start playing mobile games immediately without downloading anything.

""It's a sequence of hurdles that altogether make a bad consumer experience,"" Rubin tells TechCrunch.

Apple tells TechCrunch that they have continued to engage with Facebook on bringing its gaming efforts under its guidelines and that platforms can reach iOS by either submitting each individual game to the App Store for review or operating their service on Safari.

In terms of building the new platform onto the mobile web, Rubin says that without being able to point users of their iOS app to browser-based experiences, as current rules forbid, Facebook doesn't see pushing its billions of users to accessing the service primarily from a browser as a reasonable alternative. In a Zoom call, Rubin demonstrates how this could operate on iOS, with users tapping an advertisement inside the app and being redirected to a game experience in mobile Safari.

""But if I click on that, I can't go to the web. Apple says, 'No, no, no, no, no, you can't do that,' "" Rubin tells us. ""Apple may say that it's a free and open web, but what you can actually build on that web is dictated by what they decide to put in their core functionality.""

Rubin, who co-founded the game development studio Naughty Dog in 1994 before it was acquired by Sony in 2001, has been at Facebook since he joined Oculus months after its 2014 acquisition was announced. Rubin had previously been tasked with managing the games ecosystem for its virtual reality headsets; this year he was put in charge of the company's gaming initiatives across their core family of apps as the company's VP of Play.

Rubin, well familiar with game developer/platform skirmishes, was quick to distinguish the bone Facebook had to pick with Apple and complaints from those like Epic Games, which sued Apple this summer.

""I do want to put a pin in the fact that we're giving Google 30% [on Android]. The Apple issue is not about money,"" Rubin tells TechCrunch. ""We can talk about whether or not it's fair that Google takes that 30%. But we would be willing to give Apple the 30% right now, if they would just let consumers have the opportunity to do what we're offering here.""

Facebook is notably also taking a 30% cut of transaction within these games, even as Facebook's executive team has taken its own shots at Apple's steep revenue fee in the past, most recently criticizing how Apple's App Store model was hurting small businesses during the pandemic. This saga eventually led to Apple announcing that it would withhold its cut through the end of the year for ticket sales of small businesses hosting online events.

Apple's reticence to allow major gaming platforms a path toward independently serving up games to consumers underscores the significant portion of App Store revenues that could be eliminated by a consumer shift toward these cloud platforms. Apple earned around $50 billion from the App Store last year, CNBC estimates, and gaming has long been their most profitable vertical.

Though Facebook is framing this as an uphill battle against a major platform for the good of the gamer, this is hardly a battle between two underdogs. Facebook pulled in nearly $70 billion in ad revenues last year, and improving their offerings for mobile game studios could be a meaningful step toward increasing that number, something Apple's App Store rules threaten.

For the time being, Facebook is keeping this launch pretty conservative. There are just 5-10 titles that are going to be available at launch, Rubin says. Facebook is rolling out access to the new service, which is free, this week across a handful of states in America, including California, Texas, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia and West Virginia. The hodge-podge nature of the geographic rollout is owed to the technical limitations of cloud-gaming -- people have to be close to data centers where the service has rolled out in order to have a usable experience. Facebook is aiming to scale to the rest of the U.S. in the coming months, they say."

Here are five things you must know for Monday, Oct. 26:

1. -- Stock Futures Slump Amid Virus Surge, Doubts on Aid Package

Stock futures on Monday were kicking off a week heavy with earnings from U.S. tech giants on the downside as coronavirus infections surged, stimulus negotiations remained at a stalemate and investors prepared for the presidential election just more than a week away.

Contracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 275 points, S&P 500 futures dropped 30 points and Nasdaq futures fell 79 points.

Stocks closed mostly higher Friday but the S&P 500 fell 0.5% for the week, its first weekly loss in four, after negotiations between the White House and House Democrats on more economic aid for the struggling U.S. economy didn't make much headway.

The Dow declined 1% for the week and the Nasdaq fell 1.1%.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday the House could pass a relief package this week but ""that's up to (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch (McConnell) as to whether it would happen in the Senate and go to the president's desk, which is our hope and prayer.""

Pelosi said she sent the White House a list of remaining concerns she had on Friday and hopes to have answers on Monday.

Meanwhile, coronavirus infections in the U.S. hit a single-day record of 85,000 on Saturday. Deaths in the U.S. have passed 225,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.

2. -- Twilio, NXP Semiconductors and Hasbro Report Earnings Monday

Earnings reports are expected Monday from NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) - Get Report, Twilio (TWLO) - Get Report and F5 Networks (FFIV) - Get Report.

Hasbro (HAS) - Get Report reported Monday third-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.88 a share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.63.

Reports are expected later in the week from Apple (AAPL) - Get Report, Amazon.com (AMZN) - Get Report, Microsoft (MSFT) - Get Report, Alphabet (GOOGL) - Get Report, Facebook (FB) - Get Report, Caterpillar (CAT) - Get Report, Pfizer (PFE) - Get Report, Merck (MRK) - Get Report, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) - Get Report, General Electric (GE) - Get Report, Mastercard (MA) - Get Report, Boeing (BA) - Get Report, Ford (F) - Get Report, Amgen (AMGN) - Get Report, Visa (V) - Get Report, Shopify (SHOP) - Get Report, Twitter (TWTR) - Get Report, Kraft Heinz (KHC) - Get Report, Starbucks (SBUX) - Get Report, Exxon Mobil (XOM) - Get Report and Chevron (CVX) - Get Report.

3. -- Dunkin' Confirms in Talks to Go Private

Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) - Get Report confirmed Sunday it was in talks to be acquired by Inspire Brands, which is owned by private-equity firm Roark Capital.

“Dunkin’ Brands confirms that it has held preliminary discussions to be acquired by Inspire Brands. There is no certainty that any agreement will be reached. Neither group will comment further unless and until a transaction is agreed,” company spokeswoman, Karen Raskopf, said in a statement released to TheStreet.

The deal could be revealed as early as Monday, according to The New York Times, which first reported on the potential deal.

Dunkin' will be taken private at $106.50 a share, according to the Times, which relied on information from two people familiar with the talks. Shares of Dunkin' closed Friday at $88.79 a share, and were jumping almost 17% in premarket trading Monday to $103.75.

Dunkin' Brands is the parent company of coffee-and-doughnuts chain Dunkin’ and ice cream store Baskin-Robbins.

Inspire Brands owns Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings and Jimmy John’s.

4. -- Google Pays Apple $8 Billion-$12 Billion Annually to Be Default Search Engine

Apple (AAPL) - Get Report receives an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion in annual payments - up from $1 billion a year in 2014 - in exchange for building Google’s search engine into its products, The New York Times reported.

The deal is just one aspect of the Justice Department's suit filed last week against Google, a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL) - Get Report. The alliance between the two tech giants is an example of what prosecutors said were Google's illegal tactics to protect its monopoly and choke off competition in web search, the Times noted.

U.S. Justice Department Files Formal Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google

Google's payments to Apple are probably the single biggest payment that Google makes to anyone and accounts for 14% to 21% of Apple’s annual profit, according to the Times.

Nearly half of Google’s search traffic now comes from Apple devices, according to the Justice Department, and the prospect of losing the Apple agreement has been described as a “code red” scenario inside the company. A former Google executive told the Times the prospect of losing Apple’s traffic was “terrifying” to the search giant.

5. -- China to Impose Sanctions on Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon

China said it would impose unspecified sanctions on the defense unit of Boeing (BA) - Get Report, Lockheed Martin (LMT) - Get Report, and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) - Get Report after the U.S. approved $1.8 billion in arms sales to Taiwan last week, Bloomberg reported.

The sanctions will be imposed “in order to uphold national interests,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters Monday in Beijing. Boeing's ""Boeing Defense” division would be among those sanctioned, he said.

Boeing has “worked together successfully with the aviation community in China for almost 50 years to support Chinese efforts to ensure a safe, efficient and profitable aviation system to keep pace with the country’s rapid economic growth,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Bloomberg.

“It’s been a partnership with long-term benefits and one that Boeing remains committed to,” the spokesperson added.

Boeing shares fell 1.82% to $164.32 in premarket trading."

It's a pivotal week for the stock market rally. Hopes for a pre-election stimulus deal are fading. It's the heart of earnings season, with Apple stock, and Microsoft (MSFT) among those reporting.

X

The market rally suffered further losses last week, but the major indexes and leading stocks found support and pared losses.

Wall Street is heading into the peak week of earnings. Along with Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft stock, Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), AMD (AMD), Shopify (SHOP), Twilio (TWLO), ServiceNow (NOW) among the hundreds of companies reporting. It's the last full week before the presidential election. New coronavirus cases are breaking records in the U.S. and Europe, but Covid vaccine news could come any day. And stimulus deal hopes and doubts remain.

All of this is taking place with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq at key levels. The major indexes and many leaders, such as Microsoft stock, Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Tesla (TSLA), could offer buying opportunities with a good day or two. But one or two bad sessions could trigger serious concerns about the stock market rally.

Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks

Leaderboard Stocks

Tesla, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce stock are all on IBD Leaderboard.

Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe stock also are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Unlike Apple and Amazon stock, which are not Long-Term Leaders, these three software giants are all holding above their 10-week moving averages. The 10-week line is a good place to buy Long-Term Leaders, but investors should wait to see a little more strength in these stocks, as well as the market rally. Microsoft earnings also loom.

Meanwhile, Tesla stock also has found support near its 10-week line, with buy points or sell signals not far away. It's hard to believe it, but the Tesla news cycle might quiet down for a time.

The Latest IBD/TIPP Trump Vs. Biden Tracking Poll

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures fell 1.15% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.95%.

Along with the surge in coronavirus cases, stalled stimulus deal talks also could influence Dow Jones futures. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday blamed President Trump for the lack of a stimulus deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been stimulus deal talks with Pelosi, said the White House has offered compromises but the Speaker is ""dug in.""

The House is already out while the Senate will leave town on Monday, after the likely confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. While Congress could be called back to vote on a stimulus deal, that seems unlikely with election campaigns in the final stretch.

Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 GOP senator, said Sunday that he hopes a stimulus deal can be passed after the election.

Meanwhile, German software giant SAP (SAP) on Sunday cut its full-year revenue and operating profit forecasts, saying the coronavirus pandemic will hurt demand ""at least"" through mid-2021. SAP did beat Q3 profit views, though revenue missed.

SAP stock plunged roughly 20% in premarket trading.

Coronavirus Cases

Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 43.43 million, according to Worldometers. Daily coronavirus cases worldwide are approaching half a million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.16 million.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 8.88 million, with deaths above 230,000.

Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short and political adviser Marty Obst have tested positive for the coronavirus. NBC News reported at two more Pence aides have tested positive for the coronavirus, while ABC News said a total of five people in the vice president's ""orbit"" have tested positive.

Pence, who has tested negative again, has decided not to quarantine and will continue campaigning.

The U.S. added 81,210 new coronavirus cases on Friday, a new daily record, followed by 79,449 on Saturday. That's partly due to increased testing from earlier in the year, but positive test results are rising sharply as well. Coronavirus restrictions have eased from earlier in the year, but the biggest factor may be Americans weary of following social distancing and mask rules.

Several European countries have been hitting daily records, with Spain and France now with more than one million Covid-19 cases in total. Much of Europe has reimposed tougher coronavirus restrictions, but not much in U.S. cities and states so far.

If coronavirus restrictions are reimposed, that could stall a relatively solid economic recovery. That would likely add pressure for a new stimulus deal.

Coronavirus death rates remain relatively low, reflecting better treatments and procedures and the lag between infection and fatalities. Hospitalizations for the coronavirus have risen sharply, however.

Coronavirus Vaccine News Soon?

Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) and partner BioNTech (BNTX) could release interim effectiveness data on their coronavirus vaccine candidate from final-stage trials any day, with a possible FDA approval request by late November. Moderna (MRNA) could follow a few weeks later.

In a best-case scenario, millions of coronavirus vaccine doses will be out before year-end, targeting those most at risk. But it would still take many months to vaccinate most Americans.

Both Pfizer and Moderna report earnings this coming week.

The AstraZeneca (AZN) Covid-19 vaccine reportedly produces a robust antibody and T-cell immune response in elderly people. The U.S. part of AstraZeneca's final-stage trial finally resumed Friday following a severe reaction by one participant.

A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine also has resumed late-stage trials after a brief pause over a participant's illness. The J&J Covid-19 vaccine candidate is one of the few that would require just a single dose.

Stock Market Rally Last Week

U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 28336.62 -27.04 -0.10 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3465.59 +12.10 +0.35 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 11548.28 +42.28 +0.37 Russell 2000 (IWM) 162.98 +0.85 +0.52 IBD 50 (FFTY) 38.33 +0.30 +0.79 Last Update: 4:04 PM ET 10/23/2020

The stock market rally continued to slide, though the major indexes all found support at their 21-day exponential moving averages.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite slid 1.1%, but held its ground after tumbling 1.65% on Monday.

Apple stock fell 3.3%, closing near weekly lows. Amazon sank 2.1%. Microsoft sank 1.6%, but has now risen for the past four sessions. Salesforce retreated 3.1%. Adobe fell back 2.85%, but rallied Friday to get just above its 10-week line. Tesla stock sank 4.3%.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 2.7%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) lost 1.3%, with Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe all major components. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 1.4%.

Long-Term Leaders Near Buy Points

A good time to buy Long-Term Leaders is near their 10-week moving averages. Dow Jones stocks Microsoft and Salesforce rebounded from their 10-week lines this week, while Adobe reclaims that key level Friday.

But you want to see these stocks decisively break short trend lines in their handles, with similar action in the major indexes. But if these stocks are moving decisively higher, the Nasdaq likely will show positive action as well.

In the case of Dow Jones giant Microsoft, investors should wait until after its Tuesday night earnings.

Microsoft and Adobe fell about 1% early Monday. Salesforce stock lost nearly 2%.

Tesla Stock

After trying to break past an early entry on Oct. 14, Tesla stock has retreated, undercutting its 50-day and 10-week line on Friday but closing above those line.

Especially n a weekly chart, TSLA stock looks fine. It's been consolidating relatively tightly over the past several weeks and is once again finding support at the 10-week line. It's also forged a handle with a 466 buy point. Aggressive investors could use 445.33, just above Thursday's intraday high, as an early entry.

On the other hand, if Tesla decisively breaks below its 10-week line, investors may want to consider paring gains.

Over the last couple of months, there were several expected catalysts for Tesla stock: S&P 500 inclusion, Battery Day, Q3 deliveries and Q3 earnings. S&P inclusion hasn't happened while the other there events didn't drive TSLA stock higher. Then again, they haven't sunk the stock either.

Tesla stock fell 2% early Monday.

Tesla News About To Get Boring?

No, that's not a reference to Tesla sister company Boring.

In the next few weeks, the Tesla news cycle may actually quiet down. Sure, there is plenty going on. Tesla is exporting Model 3 cars from its Shanghai plant to Europe, taking over somewhat for the Fremont, Calif., plant.

In a new SEC filing Monday, Tesla said it expects capital spending in 2020 to be at the high end of its target range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. Capex already picked up in Q3. It sees capex of $4.5 billion to $6 billion in 2021 and 2022.

Tesla could cut the Model 3 prices in the U.S. in the coming weeks, after recently slashing Model 3 prices in China and cutting Model S prices.

No doubt, Elon Musk and Tesla will keep themselves in the public eye. The Full Self Driving beta launch is getting a lot of attention, with Tesla raising the FSD price to $10,000 on Monday even as critics note the Level 2 system's shortcomings.

But on paper, Tesla has few key ""circle that date"" events over the last couple of months. The Model Y will soon launch in China, though perhaps not until the start of 2021. Meanwhile, the Ford Mustang Mach E, a Model Y competitor, will launch in the U.S. before year-even. The VW ID.4, another Model Y rival, will start global deliveries around the start of the year.

So all of those events, along with Tesla's Q4 deliveries, herald a new round of headlines and the beginning of a critical year for the electric car industry.

These 4 Stocks Are Trading Bullishly, Offering New Buy Points

Stock Market Analysis

Heading into last week, there were reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Sure, the major indexes had pulled back, a little, but that was allowing many tech giants to form handles.

Then on Monday, Oct. 19, the major indexes suffered sharp losses, with growth names harder hit. After a couple of modest days, stocks undercut their 21-day lines in Thursday's session, with the 50-day line not far past that. Thankfully, the major indexes rebounded for slim gains, followed by Friday's rally into the close.

Arguably, the stock market rally is a good day or two from looking bullish again. Breaking the short trend lines in the Nasdaq would be a positive sign. Then again, it would only take a day or two for the market rally to look bearish, testing or undercutting 50-day lines.

Dow Jones futures suggest that the major indexes will test or undercut their 21-day lines at Monday's open, with the Dow itself sinking to around its 50-day line.

Game Plan The Market Rally

Analyze your stocks. A lot of mixed action in growth names this week. You might have cut back your exposure but still grade your current holdings. Several of your stocks may have earnings due in the next few days. Do you have enough of a cushion heading into results?

Build up your watch lists. There are a lot of good-looking charts. Many just need one push, whether from individual earnings or broad market strength, to flash clear buying signals. So you want to be ready.

Let The Stock Market Trend Be Your Friend

But while the stock market rally hasn't done anything seriously wrong over the past two weeks, it hasn't been a good environment for making money.

Earnings season is usually enough chaos for your portfolio. But this headline-driven stock market rally has so headlines to deal with right now: the presidential election, coronavirus vaccine news, stimulus deal talks. Coronavirus cases are front-and-center once again. All could swing the market one way or the other in the next few weeks.

Don't get too exposed. Wait for the market to show clear positive direction. That could happen in the next few days or weeks. There will be many breakouts and other buying opportunities if the market takes off again. If market heads lower, new buys are likely to struggle.

45,2020-10-26,05:00:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-apple-stock-earnings-long-090009944.html,Buy Apple Stock Before Earnings as a Long-Term Play?,"Apple AAPL shares are up over 6% in the last month, even though they have fallen since its October 12 event that showcased its new lineup of 5G-enabled iPhones. More recently, Wall Street has turned its attention to the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. GOOGL that partly focuses on its relationship with Apple.

Despite the concerns, it is far from certain that the lawsuit will truly shake up Google or Apple. And of course, Google has said it will fight back against the lawsuit and the litigation could take years. It is also worth noting that Alphabet stock has climbed this week, which might tell investors something.

With this in mind, let’s dive into Apple ahead of the release of its fourth quarter fiscal 2020 financial results that are due out on Thursday, October 29 to help decide if it’s time to buy AAPL stock.

Quick Antitrust Overview

Google relies heavily on search traffic from iPhones, where its flagship search engine is the current default on Apple’s Safari phone browser. The two tech giants don’t release the financial significance of this mutually beneficial relationship.

That said, reports project that Google pays Apple between $8 billion to $10 billion a year to be the default search engine on iOS devices. And the DOJ lawsuit projects that this partnership accounts for between 15% and 20% of Apple’s annual profits.

These are big numbers and the situation is worth monitoring closely. However, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon AMZN, and Facebook FB have all been under increased government scrutiny for years and it didn’t prevent any of their stocks from climbing to new highs. And their overall earnings outlook (also read: Previewing Big Tech Earnings).

Apple’s Growth…

Apple’s newest iPhone officially became available on Friday, October 23. The iPhone 12 is its first 5G-capable phone and it will be available in four models at various price points. The company priced its higher-end models roughly the same as last year’s iPhone 11, despite the new features and its 5G capabilities. The reasoning is somewhat clear: 5G is still in the early days and AT&T T and its peers still have miles to go before the next-generation wireless network reaches anything near what the current network does.

Story continues

Therefore, the price-point helps entice consumers to buy the new iPhone despite what many tech analysts say are the somewhat standard updates to features such as the camera. The next-generation wireless network will play a key role in the future and the company is prepared to benefit from the transition, as it gets people excited now.

It’s also worth remembering that Apple is one of the best marketers in retail history, and it remains the world’s most valuable brand. The ability for a high-end consumer tech firm to lift its sales by 11% last quarter to $60 billion in the heart of a global pandemic and economic crisis is impressive. And analysts have said that the pre-order numbers for the iPhone 12 Pro have been strong across all markets.

Apple’s iPhone sales popped last quarter, and its Mac and iPad sales surged amid the remote work and schooling push. Its wearables unit, which includes its smartwatch and popular wireless headphones, also jumped over 17%, while services climbed 15%. This growth helps showcase how crucial expansion beyond the iPhone is. Apple now has revenue streams coming from its massive App store, and subscription services such as Spotify SPOT competitor Apple Music, its streaming TV service, news offering, video gaming, and more.

In fact, Apple’s paid subscriptions grew by more than 35 million sequentially to reach over 550 million paid subscriptions across its various services. And executives said on its earnings call that they remain confident it will hit its increased target of 600 million before the end of the 2020 calendar year.

What Else…

Apple closed the quarter with $81 billion in net cash and returned over $21 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. AAPL’s dividend yield rests at 0.72% right now. The income seems like an added bonus for a company that’s still expanding its portfolio, which includes bringing more of its chips in-house. The move is projected to help cut costs and improve battery life and performance.

Apple trades at 6.4X forward 12-month sales. This marks only a slight premium to its industry and represents a solid discount to Microsoft’s MSFT 10.2X, as it has for years. AAPL stock has climbed roughly 90% in the past year and over 60% in the last six months. Despite its strong performance, the stock hovers around 12% off its early September highs, which clearly gives it room to run.

AAPL stock soared after it announced its 4-for-1 stock split. The cosmetic move, which Apple has done before, was made to help make its shares more attractive and attainable to a wider array of investors. The stock closed regular trading Friday at $115 per share, while Amazon trades at $3,200 and GOOGL comes in at $1,600.

Outlook

The pandemic forced Apple to push back the release of its next-generation iPhone. This saw it launch in October and not late September, which will likely boost its Q1 fiscal 2021 sales and hinder its upcoming fourth quarter results.

The success of its services and wearables divisions help make up for the seasonality of its flagship device. With this in mind, our current Zacks estimates call for Apple’s adjusted Q4 earnings to dip 9.2% on 0.51% lower revenue. Nonetheless, Apple’s FY20 EPS figure is projected to climb 9% on 5% stronger sales that would see it hit $273 billion.

Apple’s fiscal 2021 revenue is then projected to jump 15.4% above our current-year estimate to reach $315 billion, with its adjusted earnings expected to come in 24% higher. The company has topped our bottom-line estimates by an average of 16% over the last four periods, including a 27% beat last quarter. And the nearby chart shows that its earnings estimates have trended slightly higher.

Bottom Line



Apple is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that rocks an “A” grade for Momentum and a “B” for Growth heading into its upcoming earnings release. Clearly, the near-term remains uncertain and some likely want to wait to see how its results shake out and perhaps hold off until after the election before buying stocks in general.

That said, those with a longer-term outlook of a year or more might want to consider buying Apple at a 12% discount because people are addicted to their iPhones, apps and technology as a whole. And remember that Apple pays a dividend, buys back a ton of stock, and has loads of cash that will help it venture into whatever new areas might be next.

With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

48,2020-10-25,23:13:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/epics-latest-argument-fight-against-031357872.html,Epic's latest argument in its fight against Apple keeps antitrust issues front and center,"Epic Games, the game engine developer and creator of the wildly popular Fortnite game, is keeping the focus squarely on antitrust issues in its lawsuit against Apple as pressures mount to rein in anti-competitive practices of the world's largest tech companies.

Antitrust arguments are gaining ground on both sides of the political spectrum, which could present a more favorable environment for Epic to make its case.

Earlier this month the Trump Justice Department filed its antitrust case against Google even as Congress laid out its roadmap for how to limit the monopoly power of a quartet of trillion-dollar companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet (the parent company behind Google).

Epic's lawyers acknowledged in the filing that the company breached its contract with Apple, but said that it only took that step because Apple's contract restrictions are illegal, according to the company.

""When Epic took steps to allow consumers on iOS devices to make those payments directly, it breached some of the contractual restrictions that Apple imposes on iOS developers,"" the lawyers wrote. ""Epic did so because those contractual restrictions are unlawful. Epic chose to take a stand against Apple’s monopoly to illustrate that competition could exist on iOS, and that consumers would welcome and benefit from it. Epic did so without advance notice to Apple because Apple would otherwise have used its monopoly control to prevent that competition from happening.""

Ultimately, the argument comes down to whether Apple can claim ownership of commerce occurring on the phones they make and through the marketplace that companies are forced to use to access the users of those phones.

""It's a crazy, misguided view,"" according to a tweet from Epic Games founder and chief executive, Tim Sweeney.

What’s most disturbing about Apple’s position is that they seem to truly believe they “own” all commerce involving phones they make, characterizing direct payment as theft, smuggling, and even shoplifting. It’s a crazy, misguided view.https://t.co/dAOkE8fW4S — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) October 25, 2020

The argument that Epic is making to the court is that Apple’s contractual restrictions are anticompetitive and deny choice to developers and consumers.

Story continues

From Epic's perspective, it took the steps it did in creating an in-game marketplace that its players could access directly, to prove that the App Store is not a necessary part of the iOS ecosystem; ""they are just the tools Apple uses to maintain its monopoly,"" the company's lawyers wrote.

""Apple has no right to the fruits of Epic’s labor, other than the rights arising under a contract. Consumers who choose to make in-app purchases in Fortnite pay for Epic’s creativity, innovation and effort—to enjoy an experience that Epic has designed,"" the company claimed in its filing.

The legal confrontation between one of the world's most valuable tech company and one of the tech industry's rising (and incredibly popular) stars began in August when Epic Games introduced a new payment mechanism to its Fortnite app allowing gamers to purchase its in-game currency directly and bypass Apple's in-app purchase framework.

The company pushed the same update to its Android game, as well. Both Apple and Alphabet responded by taking down the company's Fortnite game from its app stores.

Earlier this month, Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers, kept a temporary restraining order issued in September in place which simultaneously protected Epic's Unreal Engine from retaliation by Apple, while allowing Apple to keep Epic's Fortnite game off of its App Store."
49,2020-10-25,23:09:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-supplier-luxshare-unnerves-foxconn-030926865.html,Apple supplier Luxshare unnerves Foxconn as U.S.-China feud speeds supply chain shift,"By Yimou Lee and Josh Horwitz

TAIPEI/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple's top iPhone assembler, Taiwan-based Foxconn, has set up a task force to fend off the growing clout of Chinese electronics manufacturer Luxshare, which it believes poses a serious threat to its dominance, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.

The project was initiated by Foxconn's founder Terry Gou, according to one of the sources, to target Dongguan-based Luxshare, which is little-known internationally but is poised to become the first mainland China-headquartered firm to assemble iPhones - a turf until now dominated by Taiwanese manufacturers.

The task force, which the sources say was created last year, has been looking into Luxshare's technology, expansion plan, hiring strategy and whether the company - which currently makes only 5% of Foxconn's revenue - is supported by any Chinese government entity.

While the U.S.-China trade war and the coronavirus crisis have intensified pressure on global supply chains, an increasingly acrimonious tech feud between the economic giants has also prompted Beijing to strengthen efforts on creating world-leading local tech firms - and Luxshare's growth trajectory fits into that mould.

""Luxshare is set to rise ... it's just a matter of how fast it could be,"" one of the sources said.

""It makes sense for China to build up its own supply chain and Luxshare is in line with that state policy.""

RED SUPPLY CHAIN

That state policy, analysts say, is gaining traction with the rise of China's ""red supply chain"", where Chinese firms with apparent government support increasingly take on the work of manufacturing products for Apple and other global firms.

""Facing the rise of the red supply chain, the threat of Taiwan manufacturers being replaced continues to increase,"" Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute, a think tank backed by Taiwan government, wrote in a September report.

Story continues

Luxshare, whose chairwoman was once a worker at Taiwanese Apple supplier Foxlink, acquired two smaller factories belonging to Taiwanese iPhone assembler Wistron in China in July. Previously, Luxshare was best known for making Apple's AirPods.

One of the sources called it a ""formidable opponent"", and said Foxconn has been conducting extensive research on Luxshare, aiming to ""defeat it completely.""

The sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter and are familiar with Foxconn's thinking, declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the issue.

Public records reveal that while Luxshare is majority-owned by Grace Wang and her brother Wang Laisheng, its minority shareholders include state-owned Chinese investment company Central Huijin Investment Ltd, which has a 1.38% stake.

Luxshare has also received over 1 billion yuan ($148.80 million) in government subsidies since 2016 to the first half of this year, a Reuters calculation of its financial reports shows. Roughly half of that sum came in 2019 alone.

Foxconn told Reuters in a statement the task force described in this story is ""not grounded in facts"" and there were ""no meetings or any other contact.""

""There have also been no other extraordinary actions taken by the management team."" It did not elaborate.

Luxshare declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

'BLOOD IN THE WATER'

Luxshare was founded in 2004 by Grace Wang, who told Taiwan's Business Today in July that she was once a worker at Foxlink, owned by Gou's brother, T.C. Gou.

Its journey up Apple's value chain has been driven in part by acquiring smaller components makers, starting with the manufacturing of connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook through a 2011 acquisition of its Dongguan neighbour Lanto Electronics, then by making acoustic components for the iPhone, and eventually by manufacturing airpods.

The company's revenue has risen in tandem with its advance up Apple's value chain - sales in 2019 hit 62.5 billion yuan, up 75% year-on-year.

That's roughly 5% of Foxconn's revenue, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, although investor bets on the company's prospects have lifted its market value to roughly $20 billion above the Taiwan firm's $39 billion market capitalisation.

Luxshare now gets 58% of its revenue from Apple, according to Morningstar Research

The company's July acquisition of Wistron's iPhone plants in Kunshan marks its most significant deal yet, which Fubon Research said could help Luxshare capture up to 30% of iPhone production within the next five years.

Two of the sources familiar with Foxconn said Luxshare had also been actively poaching from Foxconn. In one case, one of the sources said, Luxshare offered 500,000 yuan ($75,009) cash upfront as a relocation subsidy for a senior Foxconn employee to move family from Taiwan to China.

David Collins, a manufacturing consultant based in Taipei and Kunshan, says that Chinese firms see both Foxconn's legacy status, coupled with its move away from China, as prime opportunity to usurp it.

TAIPEI/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple's <AAPL.O> top iPhone assembler, Taiwan-based Foxconn, has set up a task force to fend off the growing clout of Chinese electronics manufacturer Luxshare, which it believes poses a serious threat to its dominance, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.

The project was initiated by Foxconn's founder Terry Gou, according to one of the sources, to target Dongguan-based Luxshare <002475.SZ>, which is little-known internationally but is poised to become the first mainland China-headquartered firm to assemble iPhones - a turf until now dominated by Taiwanese manufacturers.

The task force, which the sources say was created last year, has been looking into Luxshare's technology, expansion plan, hiring strategy and whether the company - which currently makes only 5% of Foxconn's revenue - is supported by any Chinese government entity.

While the U.S.-China trade war and the coronavirus crisis have intensified pressure on global supply chains, an increasingly acrimonious tech feud between the economic giants has also prompted Beijing to strengthen efforts on creating world-leading local tech firms - and Luxshare's growth trajectory fits into that mould.

""Luxshare is set to rise ... it's just a matter of how fast it could be,"" one of the sources said.

""It makes sense for China to build up its own supply chain and Luxshare is in line with that state policy.""

RED SUPPLY CHAIN

That state policy, analysts say, is gaining traction with the rise of China's ""red supply chain"", where Chinese firms with apparent government support increasingly take on the work of manufacturing products for Apple and other global firms.

""Facing the rise of the red supply chain, the threat of Taiwan manufacturers being replaced continues to increase,"" Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute, a think tank backed by Taiwan government, wrote in a September report.

Story continues

Luxshare, whose chairwoman was once a worker at Taiwanese Apple supplier Foxlink <2392.TW>, acquired two smaller factories belonging to Taiwanese iPhone assembler Wistron in China in July. Previously, Luxshare was best known for making Apple's AirPods.

One of the sources called it a ""formidable opponent"", and said Foxconn has been conducting extensive research on Luxshare, aiming to ""defeat it completely.""

The sources, who have direct knowledge of the matter and are familiar with Foxconn's thinking, declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the issue.

Public records reveal that while Luxshare is majority-owned by Grace Wang and her brother Wang Laisheng, its minority shareholders include state-owned Chinese investment company Central Huijin Investment Ltd, which has a 1.38% stake.

Luxshare has also received over 1 billion yuan ($148.80 million) in government subsidies since 2016 to the first half of this year, a Reuters calculation of its financial reports shows. Roughly half of that sum came in 2019 alone.

Foxconn told Reuters in a statement the task force described in this story is ""not grounded in facts"" and there were ""no meetings or any other contact.""

""There have also been no other extraordinary actions taken by the management team."" It did not elaborate.

Luxshare declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

'BLOOD IN THE WATER'

Luxshare was founded in 2004 by Grace Wang, who told Taiwan's Business Today in July that she was once a worker at Foxlink, owned by Gou's brother, T.C. Gou.

Its journey up Apple's value chain has been driven in part by acquiring smaller components makers, starting with the manufacturing of connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook through a 2011 acquisition of its Dongguan neighbour Lanto Electronics, then by making acoustic components for the iPhone, and eventually by manufacturing airpods.

The company's revenue has risen in tandem with its advance up Apple's value chain - sales in 2019 hit 62.5 billion yuan, up 75% year-on-year.

That's roughly 5% of Foxconn's revenue, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry, although investor bets on the company's prospects have lifted its market value to roughly $20 billion above the Taiwan firm's $39 billion market capitalisation.

52,2020-10-25,20:18:00,AAPL,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lee-kun-hee-transformed-samsung-012326151.html,"Lee Kun-hee, Korean Icon Who Transformed Samsung, Dies at 78","(Bloomberg) -- Lee Kun-hee, who transformed Samsung Electronics Co. from a copycat South Korean appliance maker into the world’s biggest producer of smartphones, televisions and memory chips, has died. He was 78.

Lee passed away on Sunday with his family by his side, the company said in a statement, without mentioning the cause of death. His family will hold a private funeral. He had been hospitalized since a heart attack in 2014 and was treated for lung cancer in the late 1990s.

Lee, who told employees to “change everything except your wife and children” during his drive to foster innovation and challenge rivals such as Sony Corp., was South Korea’s richest person. He had an estimated net worth of $20.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Samsung, the biggest of South Korea’s family-run industrial groups, known as chaebol, has been led by his only son since the heart attack.

“Chairman Lee was a true visionary who transformed Samsung into the world-leading innovator and industrial powerhouse from a local business,” the company said. “His legacy will be everlasting.”

His son Jay Y. Lee has been the conglomerate’s de facto leader since his father’s hospitalization in 2014, but it isn’t clear whether he will take over his father’s role as had long been anticipated. The younger Lee is currently grappling with two simultaneous legal disputes with South Korean prosecutors over allegations of bribery and corruption related to succession.

Lee, who has denied any wrongdoing, was in fact supposed to attend a hearing for one of those court cases Monday, but instead is expected to remain at the hospital with his family. Samsung hasn’t said who will step into the elder Lee’s role as chairman.

Samsung, the maker of the Galaxy line of smartphones, has been riding a Covid-era boom in online activity despite the legal clashes. The company also supplies semiconductors for Google’s data centers and Apple Inc.’s iPhone, and is the world’s most advanced maker of displays for TVs, computers and mobile devices.

Story continues

Samsung C&T Corp., the de facto holding company for the group, surged as much as 21%, while Samsung Life Insurance Co. rose as much as 16%. Some units at Samsung Group are expected to raise dividends, according to a note from Korea Investment & Securities. Samsung Electronics shares were little changed.

Lee Kun-hee’s heirs now face an estate tax of roughly $10 billion, and paying it may complicate the family’s control of the Samsung conglomerate -- his beneficiaries would likely have to sell some assets to cover the tax — diluting their stake in Samsung. South Korea’s levy of 50% on estates of more than 3 billion won ($2.6 million) is the second-highest among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, after Japan.

The Samsung empire includes 62 companies. Although the late Lee owned large chunks of some of the businesses — including 4.2% of Samsung Electronics — they’re not big enough to afford control of the conglomerate. The family depends on informal ties to executives who run related companies, and a lot of that soft power may dissipate with Lee’s death.

It was Lee Kun-Hee who built the company into the electronics powerhouse of today, becoming synonymous with the rise of South Korea on a global economic stage.

Named one of the world’s 100 most influential people by Time magazine in 2005, Lee began overhauling Samsung Electronics after he saw the company’s products gathering dust in a Los Angeles electronics store, according to “The Lee Kun Hee Story,” a 2010 biography by Lee Kyung-sik. The Suwon, South Korea-based company had become known for cheap, low-quality electronics gear and was in the “second phase of cancer,” sending out 6,000 people to fix products made by 30,000 employees, Lee said in 1993, according to the biography.

Why Samsung’s Billionaire Scion Faces Two More Trials: QuickTake

The company’s makeover started in 1993 when Lee gathered top executives in Germany and laid out a plan, known as the Frankfurt Declaration, to transform Samsung from a second-tier television maker into an industry leader. The company’s new mission: create high-quality products, even if it meant lower sales.

Samsung Electronics became the world’s top maker of computer memory chips in 1992, the same year it became the first to develop 64-megabyte DRAM chips, according to the company.

Lee was born on Jan. 9, 1942, in Daegu about 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Seoul, and was raised in the nearby rural district of Uiryeong, according to the company.

In 1938, his father Lee Byung-chull opened a four-story grocery store in Daegu that would later become Samsung Group.

As a teenager, Lee Kun-Hee liked movies and cars and kept to himself. He took up wrestling and played rugby in high school to fight loneliness. He graduated with a degree in economics from Waseda University in Tokyo and also studied business administration in the U.S. at George Washington University in Washington.

In 1971, Lee Byung-chull chose his youngest son to be his successor, and in 1974, the company moved into semiconductors when it acquired a 50% stake in unprofitable Hankook Semiconductor. The business turned profitable in 1988, helped by dynamic random-access memory chips it produced.

After the Frankfurt Declaration, Lee required employees to arrive at work at 7 a.m. instead of their usual 8:30 a.m. start, so they could “soak up reform in their slumber,” according to the biography.

In 1995, he assembled 2,000 workers to watch him make a bonfire out of 150,000 mobile phones, fax machines and other company products that didn’t meet his quality standards.

Lee’s cultural change eventually produced results. Samsung Electronics surpassed Tokyo-based Sony to become the top seller of flat-screen TVs in 2006, the same year its market value exceeded $100 billion.

In 2010, Samsung introduced the Galaxy-branded smartphone running Alphabet Inc.’s Android software, which helped it pass Apple as the world’s biggest smartphone maker in 2011 in terms of units sold. By introducing the Galaxy Note in 2011, Samsung created a new product niche known as the phablet, a smartphone-tablet hybrid.

Political Controversy

Samsung became the biggest seller of all mobile phones in 2012, unseating Nokia Oyj, which had been the industry leader for more than a decade. Its success in smartphones then boosted profits at its component businesses, including memory chips, display and processors.

Lee’s career was also notable for its setbacks and controversies. An expansion into the car business was unsuccessful. Samsung Motor Inc. rolled out its first automobiles in 1998 and failed to attract buyers. The unit was placed into receivership and Renault SA purchased a majority stake in 2000.

Lee was mired in political scandals in the late 1990s after being convicted of paying bribes to former president Roh Tae-woo in 1996. He was pardoned by President Kim Young-sam a year later.

In 2009, Lee was found guilty of tax evasion and breach of duty for causing losses at Samsung SDS Co., an information technology services provider, because he knew the company illegally sold bonds with warrants to his son at artificially low prices. He was fined 110 billion won and received a suspended three-year jail sentence.

Presidential Pardon

Four months after the 2009 ruling, South Korea’s then-President Lee Myung-bak pardoned Lee, a member of the International Olympic Committee, so he could help the country’s successful bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

Lee, who resigned from the board of Samsung Electronics in 2008 amid the controversies, returned as chairman in March 2010, telling employees the business was “facing a real crisis.”

“In 10 years, the majority of products that represent Samsung may no longer exist,” he said in a statement announcing his return. “We must have a new start. There is no time to hesitate.”

Two months later, Samsung Group said it would invest 23 trillion won to expand in areas such as health care and solar batteries by 2020.

Lee’s son, Jay Y. Lee, became vice chairman of Samsung Electronics in December 2012 and his daughter, Lee Boo-jin, is president of Hotel Shilla Co., a Samsung affiliate, raising concerns that the founding family would maintain its grip on the conglomerate at the expense of minority shareholders. That issue lies at the heart of the two legal disputes the younger Lee is now embroiled in.

In August 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the retrial of Jay Y. Lee over bribery charges that voided an earlier decision to suspend Lee’s 2.5-year prison sentence. A special prosecutor had indicted the Samsung heir on charges of bribing a friend of former President Park Geun-hye in return for government backing for a merger that helped cement his control over Samsung while his father was hospitalized.

In 1967, Lee Kun-hee married Hong Ra-hee. In addition to children Jay Y. and Boo-jin, he had a daughter, Lee Seo-hyun. Another daughter, Lee Yoon-hyung, died in 2005 at age 26.

Earnings Spotlight: Microsoft

Microsoft (MSFT, $216.23) is one of the best mega-cap stocks of 2020, putting up 37% gains year-to-date. But it'll be looking to kick-start what has been almost two months of flat activity with its quarterly earnings report, due out after the Oct. 27 close.

Analysts will be looking at several categories, including the company's cloud, productivity and gaming divisions.

""We expect upside to Street EPS/revenue forecasts, as we believe Microsoft's various properties (Azure/Office365/PC) should continue to benefit from accelerated digital transformation due to the pandemic and a rebounding worldwide economy driving better-than-expected transactional revenue,"" write Stifel analysts Brad Reback and Adam Borg, who rate the stock at Buy with a $245 12-month price target. ""Looking ahead for Microsoft, we expect a solid December guide, based on the aforementioned acceleration in demand, ongoing O365 gains (pricing and volume), Azure market share expansion and the upcoming Xbox release.""

Credit Suisse expects ""solid Fq1 results,"" too, though they note a little risk in Azure figures.

""A focal point of Microsoft results will be the trajectory of Azure, especially after it decelerated a bit faster than expected last quarter (F4Q20),"" write Credit Suisse analysts (Outperform, equivalent of Buy). ""We believe buy-side expectations are in the mid-40%s y/y (FX neutral). In our view, street expectations are reasonable, though slightly higher than typical seasonality.""

The headline numbers to watch: Revenues are expected to come in at $35.72 billion (+8.1% year-over-year), and profits are modeled to rise 11.6% to $1.54 per share.

THURSDAY

Earnings Spotlight: Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple and Facebook

More than a third of the S&P 500's components will report this week, but the most important time to watch is Thursday afternoon, when four companies representing more than 16% of the index's weight report: Alphabet (GOOGL, $1,632.98), Amazon.com (AMZN, $3,204.40), Apple (AAPL, $115.04) and Facebook (FB, $284.79).

Let's take a quick look at each:

SEE MORE The Best Fidelity Funds for 401(k) Retirement Savers

Alphabet: Analyst expectations are for revenues of $42.77 billion (+5.6%) and profits of $11.18 per share (+10.5%).

CFRA analyst John Freeman (Strong Buy) has raised his price target on shares by $65, to $1,930 per share, based both on Snap's (SNAP) strong results which included a rebound in online/digital ad spending, as well as ""the realization among investors that even the most recent DoJ-led action – an anti-trust lawsuit as narrow in scope and as trifling as that against Microsoft in the '90s – was filed for political effect two weeks before the election.""

Amazon.com: Analyst expectations are for revenues of $92.48 billion (+32.2%) and profits of $7.25 per share (+71.4%).

Citi analyst Jason Bazinet (Buy, $3,550 price target) believes Amazon should benefit from ""several growth engines,"" citing e-commerce and advertising. He does note, however, that Prime Day 2020 was ""the best on record"" – an interesting choice of wording that could suggest it wasn't the company's biggest shopping event ever.

Apple: Analyst expectations are for revenues of $64.16 billion (+0.2%) and profits of 71 cents per share (-6.6%).

More important than Apple's quarterly expectations are any early signs of what the recently launched iPhone 12 is doing. ""Investors are expecting 230M iPhones sold in FY21, 10% above our forecast,"" write UBS analysts. ""As we have previously noted, we estimate each 5 million incremental iPhones sold adds roughly $0.05 to our FY2021 EPS estimate of $3.84, or about 1.3%. If FY2021 units hit the buy-side bogey, our EPS estimate could be 5% too low.""

Facebook: Analyst expectations are for revenues of $19.73 billion (+11.7%) and profits of $1.89 per share (-10.8%).

""We raise our revenue growth expectations for 2H20 based on stronger checks, indicating better-than-expected ad budget growth across both core Facebook and Instagram,"" write Credit Suisse analysts (Outperform). ""We believe ad pricing continued to improve sequentially, due primarily to marketers returning to the auction.

""As we have noted previously, the most important updates for us is the number of business profiles and advertisers – as of 2Q20, these stood at 180mm and 9mm, respectively, implying a 5% conversion rate from free to paying vs the historical range of 5-8.5%. This suggests advertiser growth should accelerate as businesses rush to get online.""

Both companies continue to be hampered by sagging oil prices amid slack demand, which has been the case ever since early on in the COVID outbreak.

Here's a look at what Wall Street is looking for:

Chevron: Analysts are expecting revenues of $25.65 billion (-29.0%) and a loss of 22 cents per share (from a $1.55 profit in the year-ago quarter).

""CVX offers one of the strongest balance sheet among the Majors, a reasonably low breakeven, and an attractive and low-risk growth outlook of short-cycle investment opportunities anchored by its massive legacy position in the Permian Basin once oil prices improve,"" write Credit Suisse analysts (Outperform). Complementing its medium-term growth profile is a substantial current liquidity position, with net debt/cap and net debt leverage below peers and remaining in check despite the recent oil price weakness. … however, refining is expected to remain challenged near term.""

Exxon Mobil: Analysts are expecting revenues of $45.58 billion (-29.9%) and a loss of 21 cents per share (from a 67-cent profit in the year-ago quarter).

The real story here is whether Exxon is going to maintain its status among the Dividend Aristocrats by raising its payout, which it has yet to do in 2020.

Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta, who recently upgraded the stock from Sell to Neutral, and raised his price target from $33 to $36, believes the company is less likely to try to raise its payout amid its cash issues.

""Although we see the dividend as an important piece of the capital allocation framework, we believe a variable dividend policy would allow for cash to be returned to shareholders while still allowing the company to balance investment in attractive projects that could contribute to long term value and returns generation for Exxon,"" he writes.

The company will face tough comparisons in several categories, most notably in the core iPhone business. The COVID-19 crisis impacted Apple's supply chain earlier this year and led to delays in final testing, which subsequently pushed back the production schedule by a few weeks.

The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro launched on Friday, slightly later than usual, and after the fiscal fourth quarter had already closed at the end of September. In contrast, last year's iPhone 11 lineup launched in late September.

A ""lack of new products""

Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty released a note last week warning that analysts' expectations for the iPhone remain too high. The consensus estimate currently calls for 40.4 million iPhone units, which Huberty suggests is too optimistic. The analyst is modeling for iPhone unit volumes of just 33 million and iPhone revenue of $22.9 billion, translating into an average selling price of approximately $694.

""While results ahead of a product cycle don't tend to influence investor sentiment, we see the potential for an expectations miss on the back of aggressive consensus iPhone expectations that don't fully account for the lack of new products in the quarter,"" Huberty wrote in a research note to investors. Instead of focusing on the iPhone, investors should look at other parts of the business, as well as guidance for the holiday shopping season.

While the Cupertino tech giant did have a virtual product event in September to unveil the Apple Watch Series 6 and iPad Air 4, the latter device didn't ship until October. The smartwatch did launch about a week before the fiscal year ended, so some Apple Watch sales will be included in the upcoming earnings report.

The good news is that Huberty believes that demand for the newest iPhone is the strongest it's been in years, pointing to lead times and shipping estimates. Separately, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently noted that pre-order volumes are up and that the product mix appears to be shifting toward higher-end Pro models, which bodes well for overall profitability.

Huberty is modeling for services revenue of $14.5 billion, which would represent both a new quarterly record and 10% sequential growth. The analyst is assigning a much higher valuation multiple to the booming services segment compared to hardware products, due to the highly profitable and recurring nature of services revenue. Apple is looking to hit 600 million paid subscriptions by year-end.

While the timing of the iPhone 12 launch will affect reported results, the more important thing will be how the new flagship smartphone sells in the coming quarters. On that front, Huberty is very bullish and tells investors to buy the stock if it dips after earnings."

It's a pivotal week for the stock market rally. Hopes for a pre-election stimulus deal are fading. It's the heart of earnings season, with Apple stock, and Microsoft (MSFT) among those reporting.

X

The market rally suffered further losses last week, but the major indexes and leading stocks found support and pared losses.

Wall Street is heading into the peak week of earnings. Along with Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft stock, Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL), AMD (AMD), Shopify (SHOP), Twilio (TWLO), ServiceNow (NOW) among the hundreds of companies reporting. It's the last full week before the presidential election. New coronavirus cases are breaking records in the U.S. and Europe, but Covid vaccine news could come any day. And stimulus deal hopes and doubts remain.

All of this is taking place with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq at key levels. The major indexes and many leaders, such as Microsoft stock, Salesforce.com (CRM), Adobe (ADBE) and Tesla (TSLA), could offer buying opportunities with a good day or two. But one or two bad sessions could trigger serious concerns about the stock market rally.

Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks

Leaderboard Stocks

Tesla, Microsoft, Adobe and Salesforce stock are all on IBD Leaderboard.

Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe stock also are on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. Unlike Apple and Amazon stock, which are not Long-Term Leaders, these three software giants are all holding above their 10-week moving averages. The 10-week line is a good place to buy Long-Term Leaders, but investors should wait to see a little more strength in these stocks, as well as the market rally. Microsoft earnings also loom.

Meanwhile, Tesla stock also has found support near its 10-week line, with buy points or sell signals not far away. It's hard to believe it, but the Tesla news cycle might quiet down for a time.

The Latest IBD/TIPP Trump Vs. Biden Tracking Poll

Dow Jones Futures Today

Dow Jones futures fell 1.15% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.95%.

Along with the surge in coronavirus cases, stalled stimulus deal talks also could influence Dow Jones futures. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday blamed President Trump for the lack of a stimulus deal. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been stimulus deal talks with Pelosi, said the White House has offered compromises but the Speaker is ""dug in.""

The House is already out while the Senate will leave town on Monday, after the likely confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. While Congress could be called back to vote on a stimulus deal, that seems unlikely with election campaigns in the final stretch.

Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 GOP senator, said Sunday that he hopes a stimulus deal can be passed after the election.

Meanwhile, German software giant SAP (SAP) on Sunday cut its full-year revenue and operating profit forecasts, saying the coronavirus pandemic will hurt demand ""at least"" through mid-2021. SAP did beat Q3 profit views, though revenue missed.

SAP stock plunged roughly 20% in premarket trading.

Remember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.

Coronavirus Cases

Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 43.43 million, according to Worldometers. Daily coronavirus cases worldwide are approaching half a million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.16 million.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 8.88 million, with deaths above 230,000.

Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short and political adviser Marty Obst have tested positive for the coronavirus. NBC News reported at two more Pence aides have tested positive for the coronavirus, while ABC News said a total of five people in the vice president's ""orbit"" have tested positive.

Pence, who has tested negative again, has decided not to quarantine and will continue campaigning.

The U.S. added 81,210 new coronavirus cases on Friday, a new daily record, followed by 79,449 on Saturday. That's partly due to increased testing from earlier in the year, but positive test results are rising sharply as well. Coronavirus restrictions have eased from earlier in the year, but the biggest factor may be Americans weary of following social distancing and mask rules.

Several European countries have been hitting daily records, with Spain and France now with more than one million Covid-19 cases in total. Much of Europe has reimposed tougher coronavirus restrictions, but not much in U.S. cities and states so far.

If coronavirus restrictions are reimposed, that could stall a relatively solid economic recovery. That would likely add pressure for a new stimulus deal.

Coronavirus death rates remain relatively low, reflecting better treatments and procedures and the lag between infection and fatalities. Hospitalizations for the coronavirus have risen sharply, however.

Coronavirus Vaccine News Soon?

Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) and partner BioNTech (BNTX) could release interim effectiveness data on their coronavirus vaccine candidate from final-stage trials any day, with a possible FDA approval request by late November. Moderna (MRNA) could follow a few weeks later.

In a best-case scenario, millions of coronavirus vaccine doses will be out before year-end, targeting those most at risk. But it would still take many months to vaccinate most Americans.

Both Pfizer and Moderna report earnings this coming week.

The AstraZeneca (AZN) Covid-19 vaccine reportedly produces a robust antibody and T-cell immune response in elderly people. The U.S. part of AstraZeneca's final-stage trial finally resumed Friday following a severe reaction by one participant.

A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine also has resumed late-stage trials after a brief pause over a participant's illness. The J&J Covid-19 vaccine candidate is one of the few that would require just a single dose.

Stock Market Rally Last Week

U.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 28336.62 -27.04 -0.10 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3465.59 +12.10 +0.35 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 11548.28 +42.28 +0.37 Russell 2000 (IWM) 162.98 +0.85 +0.52 IBD 50 (FFTY) 38.33 +0.30 +0.79 Last Update: 4:04 PM ET 10/23/2020

The stock market rally continued to slide, though the major indexes all found support at their 21-day exponential moving averages.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.9% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.5%. The Nasdaq composite slid 1.1%, but held its ground after tumbling 1.65% on Monday.

Apple stock fell 3.3%, closing near weekly lows. Amazon sank 2.1%. Microsoft sank 1.6%, but has now risen for the past four sessions. Salesforce retreated 3.1%. Adobe fell back 2.85%, but rallied Friday to get just above its 10-week line. Tesla stock sank 4.3%.

Among the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) sank 2.7%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) lost 1.3%, with Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe all major components. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) retreated 1.4%.

Long-Term Leaders Near Buy Points

A good time to buy Long-Term Leaders is near their 10-week moving averages. Dow Jones stocks Microsoft and Salesforce rebounded from their 10-week lines this week, while Adobe reclaims that key level Friday.

But you want to see these stocks decisively break short trend lines in their handles, with similar action in the major indexes. But if these stocks are moving decisively higher, the Nasdaq likely will show positive action as well.

In the case of Dow Jones giant Microsoft, investors should wait until after its Tuesday night earnings.

Microsoft and Adobe fell about 1% early Monday. Salesforce stock lost nearly 2%.

Tesla Stock

After trying to break past an early entry on Oct. 14, Tesla stock has retreated, undercutting its 50-day and 10-week line on Friday but closing above those line.

Especially n a weekly chart, TSLA stock looks fine. It's been consolidating relatively tightly over the past several weeks and is once again finding support at the 10-week line. It's also forged a handle with a 466 buy point. Aggressive investors could use 445.33, just above Thursday's intraday high, as an early entry.

On the other hand, if Tesla decisively breaks below its 10-week line, investors may want to consider paring gains.

Over the last couple of months, there were several expected catalysts for Tesla stock: S&P 500 inclusion, Battery Day, Q3 deliveries and Q3 earnings. S&P inclusion hasn't happened while the other there events didn't drive TSLA stock higher. Then again, they haven't sunk the stock either.

Tesla stock fell 2% early Monday.

Tesla News About To Get Boring?

No, that's not a reference to Tesla sister company Boring.

In the next few weeks, the Tesla news cycle may actually quiet down. Sure, there is plenty going on. Tesla is exporting Model 3 cars from its Shanghai plant to Europe, taking over somewhat for the Fremont, Calif., plant.

In a new SEC filing Monday, Tesla said it expects capital spending in 2020 to be at the high end of its target range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. Capex already picked up in Q3. It sees capex of $4.5 billion to $6 billion in 2021 and 2022.

Tesla could cut the Model 3 prices in the U.S. in the coming weeks, after recently slashing Model 3 prices in China and cutting Model S prices.

No doubt, Elon Musk and Tesla will keep themselves in the public eye. The Full Self Driving beta launch is getting a lot of attention, with Tesla raising the FSD price to $10,000 on Monday even as critics note the Level 2 system's shortcomings.

But on paper, Tesla has few key ""circle that date"" events over the last couple of months. The Model Y will soon launch in China, though perhaps not until the start of 2021. Meanwhile, the Ford Mustang Mach E, a Model Y competitor, will launch in the U.S. before year-even. The VW ID.4, another Model Y rival, will start global deliveries around the start of the year.

So all of those events, along with Tesla's Q4 deliveries, herald a new round of headlines and the beginning of a critical year for the electric car industry.

These 4 Stocks Are Trading Bullishly, Offering New Buy Points

Stock Market Analysis

Heading into last week, there were reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Sure, the major indexes had pulled back, a little, but that was allowing many tech giants to form handles.

Then on Monday, Oct. 19, the major indexes suffered sharp losses, with growth names harder hit. After a couple of modest days, stocks undercut their 21-day lines in Thursday's session, with the 50-day line not far past that. Thankfully, the major indexes rebounded for slim gains, followed by Friday's rally into the close.

Arguably, the stock market rally is a good day or two from looking bullish again. Breaking the short trend lines in the Nasdaq would be a positive sign. Then again, it would only take a day or two for the market rally to look bearish, testing or undercutting 50-day lines.

Dow Jones futures suggest that the major indexes will test or undercut their 21-day lines at Monday's open, with the Dow itself sinking to around its 50-day line.

Game Plan The Market Rally

Analyze your stocks. A lot of mixed action in growth names this week. You might have cut back your exposure but still grade your current holdings. Several of your stocks may have earnings due in the next few days. Do you have enough of a cushion heading into results?

Build up your watch lists. There are a lot of good-looking charts. Many just need one push, whether from individual earnings or broad market strength, to flash clear buying signals. So you want to be ready.

Let The Stock Market Trend Be Your Friend

But while the stock market rally hasn't done anything seriously wrong over the past two weeks, it hasn't been a good environment for making money.

Earnings season is usually enough chaos for your portfolio. But this headline-driven stock market rally has so headlines to deal with right now: the presidential election, coronavirus vaccine news, stimulus deal talks. Coronavirus cases are front-and-center once again. All could swing the market one way or the other in the next few weeks.

Don't get too exposed. Wait for the market to show clear positive direction. That could happen in the next few days or weeks. There will be many breakouts and other buying opportunities if the market takes off again. If market heads lower, new buys are likely to struggle.

Read The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.

With markets showing volatile movements in recent sessions – down one day, up the next – some of Wall Street’s analysts are showing a renewed interest in high-yield dividends. Not that they have ever shied away from these steady income generators; rather, the market boom of this past summer led the Street to focus on share appreciation as the source of profits. Market fluctuations since early September have analysts and investors both taking a closer look at defensive plays.The research analysts at JMP Securities have been searching the markets for the ‘right’ buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They’ve been tapping reliable, high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice. The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of JMP’s picks – stocks with dividends yielding 7% or better – and that the investment firm sees with 20% upside or better. Annaly Capital Management (NLY)The first name on the list from JMP is Annaly Capital Management. The company inhabits the mortgage-backed security niche, with $104 billion in total assets, primarily mortgage securities backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Annaly is one of the market’s largest REITs.The corona crisis was hard on Annaly, as the economic crush of the first quarter made it difficult for loan holders to make payments. As the economy bounced back in Q2, however, Annaly’s fortunes reversed and the steep losses from Q1 turned into modest gains. Q2 revenues came in at $979 million, with EPS, at 27 cents, beating the 23-cent forecast. Looking ahead, the forecast is a 26-cent EPS for Q3. It’s important to note that Annaly has beaten the earnings forecast in each of the past three quarters.Turning to the dividend, Annaly has remained a reliable dividend payer over the past several years, with a history of adjusting the payment to keep it sustainable. The current dividend is 22 cents per common share, and was paid out at the end of September; at that rate, the yield is 12.27%. In an era of near-zero rates from the Fed, NLY’s dividend return is sky-high.JMP analyst Steven DeLaney is impressed with NLY. The 5-star analyst pointed out, “The combination of dividends paid during the [second] quarter and the sterling book value gain—the company’s best quarterly gain since the Great Recession of 2008-09 [...] We believe NLY shares should trade at a meaningful premium to peers based on the company’s size, scale, and, now, its internal management structure.""DeLaney rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy) along with an $8.50 price target. This figure suggests a 20% upside potential from current levels. (To watch DeLaney’s track record, click here)Overall, there have been 8 recent analyst reviews of NLY shares, breaking down to 5 Buys and 3 Holds, giving the stock an analyst consensus rating of Moderate Buy. The $8.04 average price target implies a 13% growth potential from the current trading price of $7.10. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks)StoneCastle Financial (BANX)Next up, StoneCastle, is a management investment company, with a portfolio that includes moves into alternative capital securities and community banks. The company focuses its investment activity on capital preservation and current income generation, committing to returning profits to shareholders. StoneCastle’s investment portfolio totals over $133 million, of which 32% is credit securitization, 26% is debt securities, and 15% is term loans.During the second quarter, BANX saw over $2.6 million in net investment income, coming out to 41 cents per share. The company’s net asset value rose to $20.27 per share at the close of the quarter; that figure was $20.93 by September 30.BANX paid out a 38-cent quarterly dividend in Q2, a payment which the company has held up reliably – with one blip upwards in December 2018 – for the past three years. At $1.52 annually, the dividend yields an impressive 8%.5-star analyst Devin Ryan covers this stock for JMP, and he likes what he sees. “The company invested a healthy $36M during the [second] quarter, which included some higher yielding and more attractive securities, which drove the sequential increase in net investment income… Given a strong quarter of investing, particularly into attractive yielding securities, net investment income stepped up solidly in 2Q20. Moving forward, given the strong 2H20 outlook for deployment, we believe it is likely that net investment income will continue to move higher… BANX continues to more than cover its current quarterly dividend of $0.38, and we believe this will continue to be the case in the coming quarters,” Ryan opined. Ryan’s is the only recent review on record for this stock, which is currently selling for $18.15. He rates BANX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $22 price target that indicates a possible 21% upside for the next 12 months. (To watch Ryan’s track record, click here)BRT Realty Trust (BRT)Last but not least is BRT Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust focused on multifamily properties. The company acquires, owns, and manages apartment dwellings, and currently boasts a portfolio of 39 properties across 11 states, totaling over 11,000 individual apartments. The company has felt a serious hurt from the ongoing corona crisis, and reported a net loss of 25 cents per share for the calendar second quarter this year. At the same time, BRT did manage to collect 98% of rents in Q2, and saw average occupancy remain above 93%. This bodes well for the company, as it does not have to carry and maintain empty or non-paying units.Also on a positive note, BRT kept up its dividend payment. The company has been gradually raising the quarterly payout for the past three years, and the current dividend, of 22 cents per common share, annualizes to 88 cents and gives a yield of 7.1%. This is more than triple the average yield found among S&P-listed companies, and more than double BRT’s dividend-paying peers in the financial sector.JMP’s Aaron Hecht sees BRT holding a solid position in its niche, writing, “With a lower price point product spread across Sunbelt markets, the BRT portfolio is generating strong results compared to peers with high-density urban market exposure... Rent growth averaged 2.2% for renewals and 0.2% for new leases, while minimal concessions were given. Rate growth and occupancy were similar in July and August 2020 compared with 2Q20.”Hecht rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $15 price target that implies a one-year upside of 20%. (To watch Hecht’s track record, click here.)Overall, BRT has a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on an even split between Buy and Hold reviews. The stock is selling for $12.56, and the average price target of $13.25 suggests a modest gain of 5%.

Also Thursday morning, on the economic data front, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will release the first print on third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), offering a first holistic look at the rebound in economic activity that took place after lockdowns lifted in late spring.

Big Tech earnings

Big Tech stocks’ run-up has cooled somewhat in the months since these companies last reported earnings results over the summer. Since July 30, Amazon (AMZN) underperformed the broader market, rising 5% versus the S&P 500’s 6.8% gain. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) tracked about in-line with the S&P 500, while Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL) each gained about 19% over that period.

Ahead of these companies’ reports, Snap (SNAP), the parent company of the disappearing photo-sharing app, posted third-quarter results that blew away expectations, setting the bar high for ad-driven tech companies. Revenue grew more than 52% as the company added more than 11 million daily active users during the third quarter, for a gain of 19%.

“The set-up for Thursday 10/29 when all four report is getting more challenging post SNAP, but we expect the ‘rising tide’ of e-commerce use and DR [direct revenue] advertising to broadly justify stock moves,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon said in a note Friday.

“We like GOOGL most into the [quarterly reports] as it has the worst sentiment and investors know travel is still bad; we believe retail strength can offset, while recovery of brand advertising and a burgeoning Connected TV story at YouTube are under-appreciated,” he added. Last quarter, Alphabet’s stock sold off after the company posted its first-ever drop in revenue, as customer companies trimmed their advertising budgets during the pandemic.

Story continues

“As we go into 2021, we also think investors will return more attention to the cloud businesses of GOOGL and our #2 preference in this group, AMZN, which is the only one for which we raised ad revenue growth in both 2020 and 2021,” Salmon added.

Amazon, for its part, reported record profit during the second quarter as net income doubled to $5.2 billion, driven by a jump in online shopping during the height of stay-in-place orders. The company’s results this week will exclude any windfall from its annual Prime Day shopping holiday, which was pushed off by three months this year to October due to the pandemic and took place after the end of the third quarter.

Facebook is also set to report on the heels of a strong second-quarter, during which revenue jumped 11% to $18.7 billion as ad spending began to ramp in May and June as stay-in-place orders lifted. But the easing of lockdowns is also expected to have reduced user engagement on the platform, as users found alternatives to scrolling through social media: The company said in July it expected to see daily and monthly active users moderate and be “flat or slightly down in most regions during the third quarter.”

Though the company endured a boycott from some major advertisers at the start of the quarter, a number of Wall Street analysts suggested the overall rebound in online ad spending from mid-summer to early fall likely provided a meaningful boost to Facebook’s results. Bank of America analysts said in a note Friday that they expected third-quarter results to come in above consensus estimates given a “robust” online ad rebound, based on their advertising checks. The analysts expect Facebook to have accelerated its revenue growth to 14% during the third quarter, versus consensus expectations for a rise of 12% to $19.8 billion.

Finally, Apple’s sales are expected to come in roughly flat over last year at $64 billion, following an 11% jump in the second quarter that had been driven by Mac and iPad sales earlier during the period. The company unveiled its latest 5G-enabled iPhone 12 about a month later than typical due to the virus, with analysts likely to home in closely on the company’s outlook for handset sales heading into the holiday season.

Each of these earnings results also comes as Washington increasingly steps up its scrutiny of some of the biggest internet giants. The Department of Justice and 11 states last week filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, accusing its search and advertising business of running an illegal monopoly. And the CEOs of Twitter, Alphabet and Facebook are set to appear before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation Wednesday morning to discuss Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which has to date helped protect online platforms from liability over user-created content.

Q3 GDP

U.S. GDP is expected to have risen by a record amount in the third quarter over the second quarter, after pandemic-induced lockdowns and stay-in-place orders drove the worst-ever single-quarter drop in economic activity earlier this year.

Third-quarter GDP is expected to rise at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 31.8%, according to Bloomberg data as of Friday, following a 31.4% slump in the second quarter.

Consumer spending and residential housing activity are expected to be the strong points in the report, given the strength in both retail sales and housing market data evident over the course of the summer. Retail sales grew during each of the three months during the third quarter, and most recently for September grew at a 1.9% pace, or double the consensus estimate for the month.

Thursday’s report is expected to show that personal consumption — which comprises about two-thirds of domestic economic activity — rebounded by 38.7% after a 33.2% drop in the previous quarter.

For at least the first month of the third quarter, unemployed Americans were still receiving an augmented $600 per week in federal unemployment benefits, offering an additional level of support to spending on top of the $1,200 stimulus checks deployed earlier on during the spring.

“Stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits have significantly boosted household incomes, which likely fueled a rapid recovery in consumer durable goods spending. Low mortgage rates and a need for more livable space has likewise generated a swift bounce-back in home sales and residential construction,” Wells Fargo economists led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note Friday. “Business investment has also likely turned up, although nonresidential construction is still weak alongside rising vacancy rates and depressed drilling activity in the oil and gas sector.”

While the third-quarter GDP print will give a comprehensive look at the July through September period, investors are mostly already looking ahead. To that end, jitters around whether another COVID-19 wave might occur during the winter, along with uncertainty around the election outcome and timing of another virus-relief bill, have pulled focus for investors.

“Overall, the fact that 3Q will be an impressive quarter (on the heels of significant damage in 2Q) is already baked in the cake,” RBC Capital Markets economists wrote in a note Friday. “Going forward, we find significant uncertainty in growth given the wide dispersion of potential COVID outcomes. As we highlighted in a recent note, our range of possible 4Q GDP outcomes spans from -7% to +7%”

Noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that iPhone 12 preorders are more than double iPhone 11 levels (only two of the four iPhone 12 phones are currently available for preorder). He predicts that 1.7 million to 2 million devices had been preordered in the first 24 hours, compared to 500,000 to 800,000 iPhone 11 devices in the same period last year.

While that's great news for Apple and a testament to the company's aggressive pricing of the 5G iPhone line-up, there's one crucial market where the new smartphones are priced exorbitantly: India. That doesn't bode well for Apple, especially as its prospects were looking up in India of late.

Apple gets pricing wrong in India once again

Apple has brought a 5G device to the U.S. at an attractive price point of $699 with the iPhone 12 mini, but the same device starts at 69,900 Indian rupees (nearly $953). The standard iPhone 12 with a 6.1-inch display is priced at 79,900 Indian rupees (almost $1,090) for the 64 GB variant, much higher than the $799 price point in the U.S.

The following table gives an idea of the steep variance in iPhone 12 pricing between the U.S. and Indian markets.

Device U.S. price

(in $) India price

(in rupees) India price

(in $) India premium

over the U.S. iPhone 12 mini (64 GB) $699 69,900 $953 36% iPhone 12 (64 GB) $799 79,900 $1,090 36% iPhone 12 Pro (128 GB) $899 1,19,900 $1,634 82% iPhone 12 Pro Max (128 GB) $1,099 1,29,900 $1,771 61%

Clearly, Indian consumers will have to pay quite the premium to lay their hands on the latest iPhone lineup compared to consumers in the U.S. This isn't something new, as import duties and other taxes have historically inflated iPhone prices in India. Additionally, India's 5G rollout is still assumed to be at least two years away, and it may take at least four to five years for nationwide deployment.

Indian consumers may not be willing to cough up a princely sum for a 5.4-inch device considering that rivals have cheaper options that offer better technology, such as higher screen refresh rates, more memory, and bigger screens. As a result, Apple may miss an opportunity to capitalize on the hype around the iPhone 12 and capture a significant market share -- especially since the average price of a smartphone in India is expected to hover around just $170 this year.

However, Apple seems to have a secondary plan in place. Despite the iPhone 12's exorbitant pricing, Apple may continue to gain momentum in India's pre-5G smartphone market, which is reportedly growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14% as per third party estimates.

Plan B

The new iPhone 12 series is currently not made by Apple in India, so the device attracts huge import duties and taxes. A report by Indian business magazine Business Today points out that Indian consumers are going to pay 21,344 Indian rupees (around $290) for the iPhone 12 mini thanks to 22% customs duties and 18% in goods and services tax (GST).

But all is not lost for Apple -- it has backup, in the form of the iPhone 11, to drive sales. Last year's flagship has been selling like hotcakes on Amazon India during the festive season sale thanks to its attractive price of 47,999 Indian rupees ($654). The e-commerce giant pointed out that iPhone 11 sales on the first day of the sale exceeded the total number of iPhones sold during the entire sale period in 2019.

The device was initially launched at rupees 64,900 (around $885) in India last year, when it was an import unit. But Apple began local production of the device in India in July this year, which allows the company to save on import duties and taxes. As a result, the device is currently being sold at a huge discount to the launch price.

The good news for Apple is that it could start making the iPhone 12 in India. Leaked documents from Brazil's telecom regulator Anatel suggest that the device could be manufactured in multiple markets, including India and Brazil. Such a development may not be entirely surprising, as Apple's contract manufacturers are ramping up their presence in the country with the help of a government-sponsored scheme.

But until an India-made iPhone 12 hits the market, Apple can expect the iPhone 11 to do the heavy lifting. And once Apple's contract manufacturers upgrade their capabilities and start manufacturing the latest models in the country, the iPhone 12 may be priced more reasonably over there.

As such, Apple can continue attracting more users toward its ecosystem in India, despite the high initial price of the iPhone 12. It can sustain that momentum going forward by gradually enhancing its manufacturing and sales presence, setting the stage for growth in a potentially lucrative 5G market where 5G device shipments could hit 144 million units by 2025, per third party estimates."

Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 shed less than 1%. The S&P is in solidly positive territory for 2020, while the Dow is down slightly.

Several widely owned companies will announce operating results over the next few trading days, including eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). Below we'll take a look at the key trends that might send their shares moving this week.

eBay's sales volumes

Investors are optimistic heading into Wednesday's announcement from eBay. The online marketplace's last operating update contained plenty of good news, including surging demand across its product categories while consumers shifted spending to online channels.

Investors are looking for more robust sales gains in Q3 even though growth will inevitably slow from last quarter's 29% volume spike. But eBay should still notch gains of at least 14%, according to the latest outlook from CEO Jamie Iannone and his team.

It will be just as interesting to see if eBay continues to pad its profitability lead over rivals like Walmart, which will allow for increasing capital returns to shareholders from this asset-light business. eBay will offer its final official update on the 2020 growth outlook on Wednesday, too.

Apple's iPhone updates

With new products like streaming music and TV platforms, Apple is transitioning its business into more of a service focus. But investors will still be closely following its hardware sales in Thursday's earnings announcement. Preorders for the new lineup of iPhones have started rolling in, after all, in what could be a massive refresh cycle for its biggest business segment.

The new iPhone releases may put pressure on Apple's short-term profit margins, which is a hit the company would be willing to take if it means a bigger base of people in its ecosystem. Look for CEO Tim Cook and his team to hint at those trade-offs when they discuss their outlook for the key holiday shopping season ahead and for fiscal 2021, which began in early October.

Starbucks' growth outlook

A lot has changed since Starbucks last updated investors about its growth outlook in late July. Executives at the restaurant chain said back then that it might take over a year for sales and profitability trends to recover from the pandemic slump, which forced sales down 38% in the fiscal third quarter.

Expectations are for those declines to moderate significantly when the chain announces Q4 results on Thursday, but it's not clear whether Starbucks is on a faster rebound pace. McDonald's recently returned to sales growth in the core U.S. market, which suggests an improved selling environment in recent weeks. However, the fast-food giant had a more modest decline during COVID-19 closures.

We'll find out this week if management still sees late fiscal 2021 as the turning point for full recovery. Thursday's report will also reveal whether Starbucks is engaged in an expensive advertising and marketing battle with rivals like McDonald's, which would pressure operating margins for the wider industry, especially if the recession stretches into the new calendar year."
